=== IDEAS ======================================================================

Classes
	Drug Dealer
		Death to Snitches - Cops will ignore your Pusher attempts. You may attempt to sell to them, but failure will turn them hostile.
		Pusher - You can interact with most NPCs to attempt to sell them any drug item you have (or simplified, just Sugar). If you fail, they become annoyed (Upper Crusters will call the cops immediately). Cops who witness a dealing attempt will go Hostile. If you succeed at a sale, they have a chance to become Hooked. After a certain interval of withdrawal, NPCs will gain the Jonesing status. They'll seek you out in the level and beg you for a particular drug. If you go too long without selling them the requested drug, they'll go hostile, but selling them other types of drugs will keep them at bay for a while. When Jonesing, they will freely give you keys and safe combos if you ask. Jonesing NPCs may also attack other drug dealers, doctors, or scientists if they can't track you down.
	Priest
		Undead Bane - All Vampires, Zombies & Ghosts are hostile on sight.
		Sermon - Activate an Altar to randomly improve relations with NPCs within earshot. Chance of them giving you Tithes.
	Repairman
		One Happy Tamper - Tamper without angering Owner
		Suffers Tools Gladly - Reduce Item durability reduction from tampering (with an Improved version that removes it completely)
	Trapper
		Cheeky Trappy - All hidden traps (so far just landmines) are visible to you. NPCs will no longer path around traps that you place.
		____ - Increase damage from traps.
		Trapper Keeper - You can Interact with traps to add them to your inventory (Bear Traps, Land Mines). 100% chance to deactivate Door Detonators.

Big Quests
	Get Thee Behind Me! - Kill all Zombies and Vampires on the map. Vampires are armed and travel in teams.
	Slingin' Dope - NPCs with enough money to buy one of your drugs will have an arrow above their head when the Big Quest is open. You need to sell to a certain number of NPCs.
	Z-Team - Zombie disaster occurs every level. Kill all Zombies and all living people carrying the Z-Virus. You get a free Friend Phone per level.

Gameplay
	removing traits:
		the same way you can gain + traits in the level up, there should be a chance for removing traits too (maybe called - traits?)
		eg: youre cannibal, level up and leave slums 1. You have a choice between im outtie, low cost jobs, and - malodorous.
	Make all traits accessible through Character Creator
	Alright my idea is that npcs can become "fearful" of the player if you just torture them in some ways
		Such as killing all of their teammates
		Also stuff like eating corpses could give them fear
		Or just continuosly destroying alredy dead npcs could give fear
		When a npc is fearfull they will hide and try to evade you at all times
		If they are from a faction they could search for another npc of that faction and treath it as a safeplace
		There could be npcs that are unable to feel fear such as robots and zombies
	Overall rework of NPC view distance.
		Probably increase the vanilla distance for balance.
		+ Giant, Loud, Lights, etc.
		- Diminutive, Darkness, etc.
	Putting the "Drunk" status effect back into the game!
		how?: well it could only happear if you have certain traits here are some ideas:
		Low tolerance to alcohol - When you drink to much beer you will get the drunk status and you accuracy and melee will go down temporarily but you can recover easily and if you just overdrink you can end up bafing removing all of you status effects wich is both good and bad (for example if you have poison this can save you)
		Bar Brawler - If you drink to much you will get drunk which gives you a + on melee
		Bonus:
			A golden trait for the robot Alcohol Energy Source makes "alcohol into energy"
			Drinking while already at full hp gives you some seconds in the energy level but it cannot make you go up by a level so it just gives you seconds.
	The Gun Fetishism Mod:
		Mechanics:
		- Bullets are smaller, faster & deal more damage
		- Ranged increases accuracy & ROF, reduces Windup, NO effect on gun damage
		- Accuracy reduced while moving, & for followup shots due to recoil
		- Chance to inflict Slow for 1-2 seconds based on weapon damage
		- Gun sprites are blacker and scarier :scream:
		- Armor plays a larger role in not dying
		Mods:
		- Silencer has varying effect, depending on the loudness of weapon
		- ROF & Accuracy mods removed completely (replaced below)
		- Autofire Mod: Full auto fire. Illegal to cops and bots. AR, Pistol, Shotgun
		- Bipod: Increases stationary accuracy. AR, LMG, Rifle
		- Binary Trigger: Fires two shots in fast succession. Not illegal. AR, Pistol
		- Flash Hider: View distance/stealth is reworked, enemies can't see you as well in the dark. Muzzle flash reduced. Any
		- FMJ Ammo: Lower damage, but ignores armor. All but Shotgun
		- Foregrip: Reduces recoil for AR, Machinegun, Shotgun & SMG. Increases fire speed for Shotgun. 
		- Hacksaw: Expands weapon spread, and damage at close range. Shotgun
		- JHP Ammo: Increases damage, but much weaker against armor. All but Shotgun
		- Muzzle Brake: Reduces recoil. Any
		- +P Ammo: Increases damage & projectile speed, increases recoil. Any
		- Red Dot: Reduces accuracy penalties of movement and follow-up shots. AR, Pistol, Shotgun, SMG
		- Scope: Allows you to move reticle further away from your character (similar to using Laptop, etc.). Increases stationary accuracy. AR, Rifle, Shotgun
		Guns:
		- AR: +Damage +Accuracy, single-fire, highly moddable.
		- LMG: ++Damage +ROF +++Recoil, ---Accuracy benefits greatly from stationary fire.
		- Pea-Shooter: -Damage +ROF +Accuracy ---Recoil
		- PDW: +++ROF -Recoil -Damage -Accuracy.
		- Rifle: +++Damage ++Accuracy, Windup before firing.
		Traits:
		- Double-Tapper: Ranged weapon equivalent to Backstabber, but only works in close range.
	Rap Sheet
		in downtown and uptown, police houses(?) will have a comms desk. If you kill 5 officers, witnessing cops will head for the comms desk and say that you are wanted, giving you the wanted trait. However, you can hack comms desk to make it say that you were pardoned by the mayor. This gives you above the law for the rest of the group of 3 floors (if done on 4-3, only for one floor, if done on 4-2, for 2 floors, etc). After that, the cops find out you were lying and you are wanted, even if not previously wanted.
		in downtown and uptown, police houses(?) will have a comms desk. If you kill 5 officers, witnessing cops will head for the comms desk and say that you are wanted, giving you the wanted trait.
		Like the hack and pardon thing is good but it doesn't sound like it's 100% there
		The 5 officers threshold is a little high. You could say if you kill any officer and a cop witnesses it, or Upper Crusters might do it if they see you kill anyone
		once activated, gives wanted trait to player
		Or, if there's a computer in a cop station, that's what they use
		I guess if a Cop is Hostile and you leave their sight/they stop chasing, they might go do it
		But if you don't leave their site, they'll try to take you down
	Rogue Vision
			I'd like to make a few modifications to gameplay to make this Mutator more playable. I prefer it for Stealth runs, but the inability to peek around corners is sort of an Achilles Heel. However, modding Field of Vision is probably too ambitious for my level (not to mention RV isn't a game mode that gets a lot of attention), so this will likely remain a pipe dream.
			Visual indicators of where sounds are coming from. This would include doors opening/closing, security cameras swiveling, etc. 
			The ability to see Cameras' field of vision if you've hacked them, or an item specific to that.
			A Special ability that places or picks up a Spy Camera for observing patrols. Or, a moveable Scout Drone.
			A Mirror you can use to peek around corners.
	Stealth Overhaul
		Visual detection
			Variable name is called "hardToSeeFromDistance", trait is same but capitalized
			base = 1
			Blends in Nicely or Goon = 1.7
			Upgraded or Super-special = 2.5
		Light Rules
			Hack computer to switch off lights
			Depending on the District, lights have a chance to be flickering. More frequent in Slums, decreases as you progress.
			Destroying a generator shuts off Lights in the Chunk? (How do you handle multiple buildings per chunk, or multiple generators per building?)
		Bodies
			Seeing a body for the first time should send other property owners into full search mode (like when an alarm goes off while hacking). 
				Any way to keep them in a longer panic state? Finding a body should be disastrous for stealth, not a momentary setback
					Maybe have Alarm buttons on every level, and they run to press one if they find a body. 
						This would need to be a mutator
			If they're unconcious, they'll wake them up after searching the area
		Light Variables

	Make Keys, Money & Safe Combos not take up a slot
	
Items
	Beer Can (1) - Generated when a Beer is consumed, or found on its own in trash cans. Thrown weapon, does minimal damage for funsies. Like a more useless Rock.
	Door Locker (2) - Use on a Door to Lock it from both sides - activate the door to unlock it.
	Doughnut (1) - Moderate healing. Can be given to Cops to make them Friendly, or to avoid paying a Fine.
	Fire Mine (4) - Behaves like a Molotov when it explodes.
	Fancy Hat (3) - Increased chances for persuasion. Maybe a Fedora, because I want you to cringe.
	Fear Syringe (1) - (Maybe not possible since there's no fear for player characters)
	Gas Trap Kit (6) - Combine with a Syringe to make a Gas Trap that you can place like a Land Mine.
	Holy Symbol (4) - When in your inventory, all Undead NPCs slowly take damage when they're near you. They are more likely to flee during combat.
	Holy Water Flask (2) - Thrown weapon that gives a Poison condition to Zombies & Werewolves. Can also be combined with a Water Gun, Air Vent, or Water Filter.
	Lunchbox (1) - Thrown item. Deals rock-level damage, drops a food item on impact.
	Mini Turret (3) - It's a Turret.
	Oil Bottle (1) - Thrown weapon that creates a splash of oil upon impact.
	Rifle (5) - High damage, slow rate of fire with warmup. Hopefully can extend range to beyond normal screen, like when using the Laptop.
	Riot Armor (3) - Resists bullets and melee damage.
	Riot Helmet (2) - Just another aesthetic option.
	Screwdriver (1) - A stabbing weapon slightly weaker than the knife. Would be used for extended tampering options.
	Spear (1) - Thrusting weapon, longest melee reach. Deals damage equal to Knife.
	Sugar Processor (6) - Similar to Bomb Processor. 
	Teleportation Trap (2) - Floor trap.
	Toxic Slime Capsule (1) - Thrown item. Inflicts poison and leaves a Goop Splash.
	Water Gun - Extended to combine with Oil Can, so you can shoot Oil.
	Whiskey Bottle (1) - Generated when Whiskey is consumed, or found on its own in trash cans. Thrown weapon, does minimal damage for funsies. Like a more useless Rock.
	Wire Cutters - Deactivate cameras instantly with no chance of failure. Destroy Barbed Wire fences. Other stuff?
	Z-Virus (2) - Solely for putting in Vents or Water Pumps. Doesn't do damage, but infects people with Zombiism.
	Magic items:
		- Mana Crystals (decay slowly but unpredictably, increase recharge speed)
		- Miscast Crystals (Rare, but absorb a miscast and shatter)
		- Ultrachungus Crystals (Temporarily boost your ability to obscene levels)
	BackPack - +inventory slots
	Body Spray: Anti-cologne, basically gives ideological clash to whoever uses it. (This would be cool in assassin quests if you could apply it to your target.)

NPCs
	Custom NPC: Tourist
		Travels in groups, occasional goon
		Behaves like Upper Cruster

NPC Goals
	Riot Behaviors
		Rioters ignore cops
			You can change this in LevelFeelings.Riot2, cops aren't mentioned there
	Accosting
		Generally want more accosting, to make the city feel like things are happening.
		Gang Members - Will attempt to mug you like Mobsters, but for a smaller amount ($50).
		Slum Dwellers - Will occasionally beg you for $5, and become annoyed if you refuse. Very small chance of going hostile. If you offer them food they'll just get annoyed.
		Jocks - Might decide to punch you in the face. You know, as a prank.
		CODE: 
			LoadLevel.SetupMore3_3() has the code that designates them to be an actual gang.
				It doesn't look like we can do anything in there, as gangbangers are already a gang equivalent to Mafia.
					I compared the two and it doesn't look like any of the variables below are set differently.
			Relationships.LastSaw
				if (this.agent.talkText.myText.text == this.gc.nameDB.GetName(this.agent.agentName + "_Mug", "Dialogue") || this.agent.talkText.myText.text == this.gc.nameDB.GetName("NA_Mug", "Dialogue"))
					So it's never called by name in a string, it's constructed by agent name. Search _mug instead.
					The search for this string is returned as a bool, where it will only return true if an agent's name is Mafia.
						Therefore, you may be able to enable this behavior simply by adding Names as Gangbanger_Mug & GangbangerB_Mug
			Relationships.ProtectOwnedLight @ 4371 ←←←

	Change NPC behaviors during some disasters. E.g., Zombie attacks will cause cops to stop enforcing minor laws like property destruction. Some NPCs will join you automatically for safety.

NPC Interactions
	Bouncers - You can come in if for free if they see you smoke cigarettes. Because obviously it means you're cool.
	Cops  
		Will attempt to fine you for petty crimes like destroying trash cans, instead of going hostile.

	Scientists - Hire to put poison in a Vent
	Thieves - Hire to unlock Safes
	Workers - Hire to Tamper

Mutators
	All Walls Are Wood
	All Walls Are Steel

	District-related spawns
		LevelEditor.CreateLevelFeatureList
	
Objects
	Cash Register - A tough locked object containing money, that may be unlocked through the chunk's Computer, Hacked, Lockpicked, or pried open with a Crowbar. Easier than a Safe, yes, but almost always within the view of their owner.
	Chemistry Set - Sacrifice a syringe to identify that type.
	Dumpster - A big metal dumpster that you can hide in, for settings where Bushes or Bathtubs aren't appropriate.
	Oil Barrel - A Rust-colored barrel which creates an oil pool when destroyed.

	Other Objects - Simply for visual variety when making custom chunks. Statues, park benches, filing cabinets, glass tables, office chairs, paintings, gym equipment, beer taps, curtains, etc. 

Object interactions
	Tampering
		Air Conditioning Unit - Tamper to Release Gas without access to main computer (not sure about this one). 
		Generator & Overclocked Generator - Able to Rig to Detonate via Hacking. Maybe only through computer, who knows. This one will be very OP for anyone with a Laptop, but Laptops are already OP.
		Speaker - Tamper or Hack to make it very loud, blowing wind like the Air Gun.
		Toilet - Tamper to...? Maybe spray water like hydrant, useful for keeping hallways clear. Or maybe some other behavior, not sure yet.
		ATM - Get money, risk setting off alarm (larger ATM overhaul)
		Ammo Dispenser - Get one free refill, risk exploding (shoot bullets everywhere - should also be intentional with hack)
		AugmentationBooth - Free XP Juice
		Bed - Fucking explode if someone tries to sleep in it
		CloneMachine - Spit out a Shapeshifter

		You can reattempt but they might go hostile.
	Magic
		Chronomancy
			Hammertime doesn't do any damage to others. 
				Tried using Explosion_ExplosionHit but it was a can of worms.

	SACRIFICE
		You can only regain health by burning corpses

		Enemies have a better chance of crit against you
			Or just add that to Unlucky

=== SHELVED ====================================================================
