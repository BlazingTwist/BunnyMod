=== PLANNING ===================================================================

Roamers
	Random.InitState - is this behavior? Havent' looked yet


=== IDEAS ======================================================================

Classes
	Drug Dealer
		Death to Snitches - Cops will ignore your Pusher attempts. You may attempt to sell to them, but failure will turn them hostile.
		Pusher - You can interact with most NPCs to attempt to sell them any drug item you have (or simplified, just Sugar). If you fail, they become annoyed (Upper Crusters will call the cops immediately). Cops who witness a dealing attempt will go Hostile. If you succeed at a sale, they have a chance to become Hooked. After a certain interval of withdrawal, NPCs will gain the Jonesing status. They'll seek you out in the level and beg you for a particular drug. If you go too long without selling them the requested drug, they'll go hostile, but selling them other types of drugs will keep them at bay for a while. When Jonesing, they will freely give you keys and safe combos if you ask. Jonesing NPCs may also attack other drug dealers, doctors, or scientists if they can't track you down.
	Priest
		Undead Bane - All Vampires, Zombies & Ghosts are hostile on sight.
		Sermon - Activate an Altar to randomly improve relations with NPCs within earshot. Chance of them giving you Tithes.
	Repairman
		One Happy Tamper - Tamper without angering Owner
		Suffers Tools Gladly - Reduce Item durability reduction from tampering (with an Improved version that removes it completely)
	Trapper
		Cheeky Trappy - All hidden traps (so far just landmines) are visible to you. NPCs will no longer path around traps that you place.
		____ - Increase damage from traps.
		Trapper Keeper - You can Interact with traps to add them to your inventory (Bear Traps, Land Mines). 100% chance to deactivate Door Detonators.

Big Quests
	Get Thee Behind Me! - Kill all Zombies and Vampires on the map. Vampires are armed and travel in teams.
	Slingin' Dope - NPCs with enough money to buy one of your drugs will have an arrow above their head when the Big Quest is open. You need to sell to a certain number of NPCs.
	Z-Team - Zombie disaster occurs every level. Kill all Zombies and all living people carrying the Z-Virus. You get a free Friend Phone per level.

Gameplay Overhauls
	Election Rebalance
		Influencing the Election
		Reputation Carryover
			Depending on your ending electability for a District, NPCs will have a starting attitude on later floors.
			-10 or lower: Hostile
			-9 to -5: Annoyed
			-4 to +4: Neutral
			+5 to +10: Friendly
			+10 to +15: Loyal
			+15 or higher: Aligned
			Slums: Gang Members
			Industrial: Workers
			Park: Gorillas, Cannibals if you have CWC
			Downtown: Bouncer
			Uptown: Upper Cruster
		Faction Reputations
			Same as Reputation Carryover, but influenced by behaviors
				Blahds
				Crepes
				Mafia, Bouncers
				Police
				Workers, Slum Dwellers, Office Drones, Clerks
				Upper Crusters, Doctors, Investment Bankers, Scientists
	Mugging & Extorting
		Add a 0.5s delay between failure and attack
		Can go Submissive from Mugging (no one will die for pocket change)
	removing traits:
		the same way you can gain + traits in the level up, there should be a chance for removing traits too (maybe called - traits?)
		eg: youre cannibal, level up and leave slums 1. You have a choice between im outtie, low cost jobs, and - malodorous.
	Make all traits accessible through Character Creator
	Alright my idea is that npcs can become "fearful" of the player if you just torture them in some ways
		Such as killing all of their teammates
		Also stuff like eating corpses could give them fear
		Or just continuosly destroying alredy dead npcs could give fear
		When a npc is fearfull they will hide and try to evade you at all times
		If they are from a faction they could search for another npc of that faction and treath it as a safeplace
		There could be npcs that are unable to feel fear such as robots and zombies
	Overall rework of NPC view distance.
		Probably increase the vanilla distance for balance.
		+ Giant, Loud, Lights, etc.
		- Diminutive, Darkness, etc.
	Putting the "Drunk" status effect back into the game!
		how?: well it could only happear if you have certain traits here are some ideas:
		Low tolerance to alcohol - When you drink to much beer you will get the drunk status and you accuracy and melee will go down temporarily but you can recover easily and if you just overdrink you can end up bafing removing all of you status effects wich is both good and bad (for example if you have poison this can save you)
		Bar Brawler - If you drink to much you will get drunk which gives you a + on melee
		Bonus:
			A golden trait for the robot Alcohol Energy Source makes "alcohol into energy"
			Drinking while already at full hp gives you some seconds in the energy level but it cannot make you go up by a level so it just gives you seconds.
	The Gun Fetishism Mod:
		Mechanics:
		- Bullets are smaller, faster & deal more damage
		- Ranged increases accuracy & ROF, reduces Windup, NO effect on gun damage
		- Accuracy reduced while moving, & for followup shots due to recoil
		- Chance to inflict Slow for 1-2 seconds based on weapon damage
		- Gun sprites are blacker and scarier :scream:
		- Armor plays a larger role in not dying
		Mods:
		- Silencer has varying effect, depending on the loudness of weapon
		- ROF & Accuracy mods removed completely (replaced below)
		- Autofire Mod: Full auto fire. Illegal to cops and bots. AR, Pistol, Shotgun
		- Bipod: Increases stationary accuracy. AR, LMG, Rifle
		- Binary Trigger: Fires two shots in fast succession. Not illegal. AR, Pistol
		- Flash Hider: View distance/stealth is reworked, enemies can't see you as well in the dark. Muzzle flash reduced. Any
		- FMJ Ammo: Lower damage, but ignores armor. All but Shotgun
		- Foregrip: Reduces recoil for AR, Machinegun, Shotgun & SMG. Increases fire speed for Shotgun. 
		- Hacksaw: Expands weapon spread, and damage at close range. Shotgun
		- JHP Ammo: Increases damage, but much weaker against armor. All but Shotgun
		- Muzzle Brake: Reduces recoil. Any
		- +P Ammo: Increases damage & projectile speed, increases recoil. Any
		- Red Dot: Reduces accuracy penalties of movement and follow-up shots. AR, Pistol, Shotgun, SMG
		- Scope: Allows you to move reticle further away from your character (similar to using Laptop, etc.). Increases stationary accuracy. AR, Rifle, Shotgun
		Guns:
		- AR: +Damage +Accuracy, single-fire, highly moddable.
		- LMG: ++Damage +ROF +++Recoil, ---Accuracy benefits greatly from stationary fire.
		- Pea-Shooter: -Damage +ROF +Accuracy ---Recoil
		- PDW: +++ROF -Recoil -Damage -Accuracy.
		- Rifle: +++Damage ++Accuracy, Windup before firing.
		Traits:
		- Double-Tapper: Ranged weapon equivalent to Backstabber, but only works in close range.
	Rap Sheet
		in downtown and uptown, police houses(?) will have a comms desk. If you kill 5 officers, witnessing cops will head for the comms desk and say that you are wanted, giving you the wanted trait. However, you can hack comms desk to make it say that you were pardoned by the mayor. This gives you above the law for the rest of the group of 3 floors (if done on 4-3, only for one floor, if done on 4-2, for 2 floors, etc). After that, the cops find out you were lying and you are wanted, even if not previously wanted.
		in downtown and uptown, police houses(?) will have a comms desk. If you kill 5 officers, witnessing cops will head for the comms desk and say that you are wanted, giving you the wanted trait.
		Like the hack and pardon thing is good but it doesn't sound like it's 100% there
		The 5 officers threshold is a little high. You could say if you kill any officer and a cop witnesses it, or Upper Crusters might do it if they see you kill anyone
		once activated, gives wanted trait to player
		Or, if there's a computer in a cop station, that's what they use
		I guess if a Cop is Hostile and you leave their sight/they stop chasing, they might go do it
		But if you don't leave their site, they'll try to take you down
	Rogue Vision
			I'd like to make a few modifications to gameplay to make this Mutator more playable. I prefer it for Stealth runs, but the inability to peek around corners is sort of an Achilles Heel. However, modding Field of Vision is probably too ambitious for my level (not to mention RV isn't a game mode that gets a lot of attention), so this will likely remain a pipe dream.
			Visual indicators of where sounds are coming from. This would include doors opening/closing, security cameras swiveling, etc. 
			The ability to see Cameras' field of vision if you've hacked them, or an item specific to that.
			A Special ability that places or picks up a Spy Camera for observing patrols. Or, a moveable Scout Drone.
			A Mirror you can use to peek around corners.
	Stealth Overhaul
		Visual detection
			Variable name is called "hardToSeeFromDistance", trait is same but capitalized
			base = 1
			Blends in Nicely or Goon = 1.7
			Upgraded or Super-special = 2.5
		Light Rules
			Hack computer to switch off lights
			Depending on the District, lights have a chance to be flickering. More frequent in Slums, decreases as you progress.
			Destroying a generator shuts off Lights in the Chunk? (How do you handle multiple buildings per chunk, or multiple generators per building?)
		Bodies
			Seeing a body for the first time should send other property owners into full search mode (like when an alarm goes off while hacking). 
				Any way to keep them in a longer panic state? Finding a body should be disastrous for stealth, not a momentary setback
					Maybe have Alarm buttons on every level, and they run to press one if they find a body. 
						This would need to be a mutator
			If they're unconcious, they'll wake them up after searching the area
		Light Variables
			Agent.extraLight
			Agent.hasLight
			Agent.LightingTypeMedNon
			Agent.lightBrightnessTiming
			Agent.MostRecentLandPosLight
			Agent.MostRecentLandPosLight2
			Agent.rogueLight
			****Agent.SetLightBrightness
			gc.lightingType
			gc.spawnerMain.SetLighting()
			ObjectReal.noLight
			SpawnerMain 7100
			TileInfo.TurnOffLights
			TileInfo.noLightColliders
		Hiding in a box should slightly reduce movement speed (by like 0.5)
	Make Keys, Money & Safe Combos not take up a slot
	
Items
	Beer Can (1) - Generated when a Beer is consumed, or found on its own in trash cans. Thrown weapon, does minimal damage for funsies. Like a more useless Rock.
	Door Locker (2) - Use on a Door to Lock it from both sides - activate the door to unlock it.
	Doughnut (1) - Moderate healing. Can be given to Cops to make them Friendly, or to avoid paying a Fine.
	Fire Mine (4) - Behaves like a Molotov when it explodes.
	Fancy Hat (3) - Increased chances for persuasion. Maybe a Fedora, because I want you to cringe.
	Fear Syringe (1) - (Maybe not possible since there's no fear for player characters)
	Gas Trap Kit (6) - Combine with a Syringe to make a Gas Trap that you can place like a Land Mine.
	Holy Symbol (4) - When in your inventory, all Undead NPCs slowly take damage when they're near you. They are more likely to flee during combat.
	Holy Water Flask (2) - Thrown weapon that gives a Poison condition to Zombies & Werewolves. Can also be combined with a Water Gun, Air Vent, or Water Filter.
	Lunchbox (1) - Thrown item. Deals rock-level damage, drops a food item on impact.
	Mini Turret (3) - It's a Turret.
	Oil Bottle (1) - Thrown weapon that creates a splash of oil upon impact.
	Rifle (5) - High damage, slow rate of fire with warmup. Hopefully can extend range to beyond normal screen, like when using the Laptop.
	Riot Armor (3) - Resists bullets and melee damage.
	Riot Helmet (2) - Just another aesthetic option.
	Screwdriver (1) - A stabbing weapon slightly weaker than the knife. Would be used for extended tampering options.
	Spear (1) - Thrusting weapon, longest melee reach. Deals damage equal to Knife.
	Sugar Processor (6) - Similar to Bomb Processor. 
	Teleportation Trap (2) - Floor trap.
	Toxic Slime Capsule (1) - Thrown item. Inflicts poison and leaves a Goop Splash.
	Water Gun - Extended to combine with Oil Can, so you can shoot Oil.
	Whiskey Bottle (1) - Generated when Whiskey is consumed, or found on its own in trash cans. Thrown weapon, does minimal damage for funsies. Like a more useless Rock.
	Wire Cutters - Deactivate cameras instantly with no chance of failure. Destroy Barbed Wire fences. Other stuff?
	Z-Virus (2) - Solely for putting in Vents or Water Pumps. Doesn't do damage, but infects people with Zombiism.
	Magic items:
		- Mana Crystals (decay slowly but unpredictably, increase recharge speed)
		- Miscast Crystals (Rare, but absorb a miscast and shatter)
		- Ultrachungus Crystals (Temporarily boost your ability to obscene levels)
	BackPack - +inventory slots
	Body Spray: Anti-cologne, basically gives ideological clash to whoever uses it. (This would be cool in assassin quests if you could apply it to your target.)

NPCs
	Artist
	Farmer
	Detective
	Junkie
	Reporter
	Security Guard
	Tourist
		Travels in groups, occasional goon
		Behaves like Upper Cruster


NPC Goals
	Accosting
		Cannibal - If you have CWC, they will ask to take a bite of you. You can agree or not. That's it.
		Cop - Might solicit a little bribe. If you have Cop Debt, it goes towards that total.
		Gang Member - Will attempt to mug you like Mobsters, but for a smaller amount ($15 * gang size).
		Office Drone - Will blab about sports. You can choose to blab back and get a new relation, from Annoyed to Loyal.
		Slum Dweller - 
			Will occasionally beg you for money. Percent chance of outcome based on donation:
						Hostile		Annoyed		Neutral		Friendly	Loyal		Aligned		Item Equivalent
				$ 0			10			55			35			 0			 0			 0			--
				$ 5			 0			 5			25			65			 5			 0			Fud

				$50			 0			 0			 0			 0			 0		   100			Sugar
				$FU		   100			 0			 0			 0			 0			 0			Banana Peel
			When done, randomly generate dialogue:
				"i can feel the shadows consuming me, quck i need your cash!"
				"Gimme money so i can have my last fix before rapture 2.0 destroys us all!"
				"c'mon you gotta protect me, the Illuminati spy-cams are coming!"
				"they injected me with liquid Antichrist"
				"fud 0 is real! Help fund my research to figure out where big fud is hiding it!"
				"i control the elements! Gimme your money or perish!"
				Alignment line: (only on a level that is a multiple of 2: EG: 1-2, 2-2, 3-2...) "Can't you feel it? a disaster is coming!"
				Alignment line: "the gates of [silly call of Cthulhu sounding name] are going to open any second now, i can feel it!"
				Alignment line "i can see them... the bars above peoples heads, theyre up to something, i know it!"
				Alignment line:"beds are too soft to be real, its a ploy to get us in our most vulnerable state!"
				Alignment line: "I'm getting closer to finding the big brother that watches over us all, i just need to figure out what 'someone' is code for..."
				imma refer to lines where they aggro on you cus you gave them food or didnt pay them as aggro lines
				Aggro line: "Illuminati scum!"
				Aggro line: "i knew it! You captured michal jackson, didnt you? WHERE ARE YOU HIDING HIM?!?"
		Scientist - Asks you to take a random pill or syringe. Gives you $20.
		Wrestler - Challenges you to a duel, just like the player character. If you refuse, he gets annoyed.
	Random Actions
		Jock - Might decide to punch you in the face. You know, as a prank.
	Cops
		If there's a Computer in a Police Station, and an Annoyed or Hostile Cop stops chasing you, they'll go there and enter your information into the database. If they're successful, all cops on the level will match their attitude towards you if theirs isn't currently worse.
			You can Hack the computer to undo this change.

NPC Interactions
	Bouncers - You can come in if for free if they see you smoke cigarettes. Because obviously it means you're cool.
	Cops  
		Will attempt to fine you for petty crimes like destroying trash cans, instead of going hostile.
		Bribe is a % chance to succeed, annoy, or turn them hostile.
	Cop Bot - Tamper to deactivate them (Requires One Happy Tamper or Tech Expert). Maybe this will be a % chance for them to trust you, like robbing/extorting.
	Scientists - Hire to put poison in a Vent
	Thieves - Hire to unlock Safes
	Workers - Hire to Tamper

Mutators
	Zoom Levels
		https://discord.com/channels/187414758536773632/433748059172896769/815314079408980000
	All Walls Are Wood
	All Walls Are Steel
	Major disaster behavior changes
		Cops don't enforce property damage laws
		Some NPCs will join your party for safety
	Riot
		Add Arsonists to spawns
		Rioters shouldn't ignore cops
			You can change this in LevelFeelings.Riot2, cops aren't mentioned there
	Mafia spawn on all levels
		Would be extremely easy, just set LevelData.levelFeatures.Contains("Mafia") to true
	District-related spawns
		LevelEditor.CreateLevelFeatureList
	
Objects
	Cash Register - A tough locked object containing money, that may be unlocked through the chunk's Computer, Hacked, Lockpicked, or pried open with a Crowbar. Easier than a Safe, yes, but almost always within the view of their owner.
	Chemistry Set - Sacrifice a syringe to identify that type.
	Dumpster - A big metal dumpster that you can hide in, for settings where Bushes or Bathtubs aren't appropriate.
	Oil Barrel - A Rust-colored barrel which creates an oil pool when destroyed.
	Kitchen Fryer - When destroyed, leaves a pool of oil.
	Pay Phone - Call the Resistance to send a Specialist over. Choose between Hacker, Thief, and Goon. 
	Refrigerator - Tamper to make it Run after a 10s countdown
	Safe - Open with Detonator.
	Security Door - Steel door, not openable with lockpick or crowbar. Can only be opened via a connected computer.
	Television - Tamper to make it increase in volume immediately, and explode after a 10s countdown
	Trampoline - Does annoying jumping behavior. I hate it already.
	Other Objects - Simply for visual variety when making custom chunks. Statues, park benches, filing cabinets, glass tables, office chairs, paintings, gym equipment, beer taps, curtains, etc. 

Object interactions
	Tampering
		Air Conditioning Unit - Tamper to Release Gas without access to main computer (not sure about this one). 
		Toilet - Tamper to...? Maybe spray water like hydrant, useful for keeping hallways clear. Or maybe some other behavior, not sure yet.
		Bed - Fucking explode if someone tries to sleep in it
	Alarms on Chests/Safes, Doors & Windows
		- Common in high-security chunks.
		- If one is present, interacting will give you a chance to attempt to disarm the alarm. This might use a tool (wire cutters?) as a bonus to success. 
		- You can hack them, of course, or disable them from a computer.
		- Or, you can just open or destroy the object and set the alarm off. 

		This would add a small, simple layer to intrusion that currently is sort of a glaring omission in terms of portraying real-world stuff.
		
Special Abilities
	Beggar | 2 Points | Beg random people for something. Either get a food item or cigarettes. 50/50 Chance. Success will make Agent friendly, failure will annoy them.
		You can reattempt but they might go hostile.
	Magic
		Chronomancy
		Electromancy
			Split only triggers when it hits a wall, not an agent.
		Morphomancy: Assume the appearance of someone else, and gain all of their relations to other NPCs
			Having someone else's appearance costs 5 mana per second
			Miscasting turns you into a gorilla temporarily
		Pyromancy
			Custom Firebomb explosion without glass sound
				This was a can of worms when I tried it with HammerTime. All we need is to stop the glass sound, so maybe that'l be simpler.
			Fan of Fire - 3 flames per shot // Fan of Fire + - 5 per shot
			These should both be set to an angle proportionate to their speed. If the speed is high, keep them narrow. If it's low, keep them wide and more like a fan. They also decrease 
			Ring of Fire - Shorter range, but 360 degrees
		Fireball
			Would need a new Projectile type
		Hematomancy 
			Blood Magic
		Kinetomancy  
			Telekinesis
		Megaleiomancy 
			Charm Person
		Necromancy
			Normal Use
				1 Summon hostile Zombies from corpses / Turn ghosts into small number of crystals

				3 Zombies will join your party / Turn ghosts into large number of crystals
				When close to a ghost, you can turn them into mana crystals
			Miscast 
				turns all of them hostile, or summons hostile ghosts
			Also:
				https://www.reddit.com/r/streetsofrogue/comments/lhdwnx/my_third_entree_for_medieval_themed_characters/
		Telemancy
			EMP on teleport?
			Stun on teleport?

		If you have no followers, you suffer lowered accuracy, melee, and speed. (decrease of 1 in each stat)

	Needy (-6 Points)
		You have needs like the musician, but they are not beneficial to you or anybody else. (You need to go to the toilet, etc)
		You need to use the nice toilet. Which always happens to be in some inconvenient place like the closet of a gang hideout. That timer is rapidly ticking down, and if you don't go to that specific toilet, you'll have an accident, and no NPC or shop owner, etc will want to talk to you.

**Hacking Overhaul**

- Greatly increase the possibilities, risks, rewards, and trait investment for hacking
- Ground Rules
	- Attempt: Every action while hacking has a % chance of success displayed next to its button. 
	- System: The collection of Objects under one Owner ID in a particular chunk that has a Computer. If there's no Computer, the object is a System unto itself.
	- Heat: This is a baseline increased difficulty to all Attempts in a System. It is increased whenever you pass an Attempt, more when you fail one. Remote access leads to higher heat than using a machine in person. Some Objects when not part of a System will have their own Heat, like ATMs. Refrigerators, not so much.
	- Password: Occasionally found in a Computer's owner's pocket. Might also be found hidden somewhere in a Computer. Submissive NPCs will give you their passwords. Pretty much a Safe Combo except for Computers.
	- PayData: Questgivers will occasionally request this, which you need to retrieve from an intact Computer. Hackers will buy PayData, sometimes a better offer than completing your Quest. PayData has a small chance of appearing without a Quest attached.
- A failed Attempt in a System may have different results, depending on how much your Attempt failed by, compared to Heat:
	1. Can reattempt, Heat+.
	2. Action Locked, Heat++.
	3. Action Locked, Heat++, any Hacker owners search.
	4. Action Locked, Heat+++, triggers Alarm, owners search.
	5. System Locked, Heat++++, triggers Alarm, owners search, and a squad of Cop Bots is deployed to search for you.
	6. Computer is destroyed, triggers Alarm, owners search, and a squad of Cop Bots is deployed to search for you.
- Traits:
	- Tech Expert is replaced by several traits. What's not in here is covered by Explosives Expert and Mechanical Expert (separate overhauls)
	- Cyber-Intruder - Improve your Attempt rolls.
	- Data Broker - Increase sell price of PayData, and its chance of appearing in a System.
	- IOT God - Enables non-Computer Object hack actions. Many of the vanilla hack actions (Like "Refrigerator Run") would be hidden behind this trait.
	- IP Ghost - Reduces initial Heat & slows its increase.
- Generic Computer Actions:
	- Access PayData: Relatively difficult but valuable, so you'll probably need to make sure you're prepared.
	- Access System: The initial entry to a System is technically an Attempt. This also applies if you're trying to acces a system that has been Locked.
	- Lights: Turns on or off all Lights in the Chunk. (See Stealth Overhaul)
	- Cut Power: Shuts down the power for the Chunk. Can be brought back up with a Generator or Power Box.
