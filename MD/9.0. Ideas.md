## Big Quests
- Gambling Addiction
  - This would require an extension to gamble with Roamers
  - Trait: Gambler
    - Can play Street craps with anyone Neutral or better
      - Street Craps Rules
        1. Players must first identify the player who will be shooting dice – the shooter. The shooter will then need to make a bet followed by the rest of the group in the clockwise direction. Each player can cover a portion of or all of the shooter’s bet. Betting continues until the shooter’s wager is matched.
        2. The come out roll comes next. This is the game’s first roll and it could end the game if it is a 7, 11, 2, 3 or 12. The shooter and any other player who bet in favor of the shooter win the game if a 7 or 11 is rolled. If a 2, 3 or 12 come up when the dice are rolled the shooter and other players who bet for him lose.
        3. A Point number, which is a number other than those mentioned above, must be set up. So if the come out roll is not any of those numbers listed above that number will be designated as the point number.
        4. The roll is next and the goal is for the shooter to roll the number identified as the point before he rolls a 7. The 7 is referred to an “Out 7” and once the shooter gets this before rolling the point he loses the game.
        5. Rolling dice proceeds until a 7 or the Point is rolled. The shooter loses if the 7 comes up and wins if the Point is rolled. If other numbers are rolled the shooter continues rolling the dice. The round ends only after a 7 or the point is rolled.
        6. It is important that you remember that all bets should be made before the come out roll and you will only win what you bet. As you can see the street craps rules are very similar to rules of casino craps.

- How?
  - Body parts: GameResources.SetupDics has at least mention of the names
    

## Disasters
- Gang War: Spawn ~12 Blahd and Crepe gangs across the map.
- Riot
  - Add Arsonists to spawns
  - Rioters shouldn't ignore cops
   	- You can change this in LevelFeelings.Riot2, cops aren't mentioned there

## Items

- Water Gun
  - Extended to combine with Oil Can, so you can shoot Oil.
- Magic items:
	- Mana Crystals (decay slowly but unpredictably, increase recharge speed)
	- Miscast Crystals (Rare, but absorb a miscast and shatter)
	- Ultrachungus Crystals (Temporarily boost your ability to obscene levels)
- BackPack
  - +inventory slots

### Consumable
- Battery Pack
  - Heal 20HP for Electronic characers
  - Obviously, could have a lot more other uses.
- Body Spray
  - Anti-cologne, basically gives ideological clash to whoever uses it. 
    - This would be cool in assassin quests if you could apply it to your target
- Fear Syringe (1)
  - (Maybe not possible since there's no fear for player characters)
- H.E.L.T.H.
  - Heals for 5
  - Gives Painkiller (Large Damage Resist) for 30s
- NRG-Drinqq
  - Basically temporary Chronomantic Dilation

### Melee
- Garotte / Piano Wire (2)
  - Zero damage, but deals lethal damage if used for Backstab.
    - You could base this on the Blood sucking ability to make it take a second or two.

- Spear (1)
  - Thrusting weapon, longest melee reach. Deals damage equal to Knife.
- Zip-Tie
  - Consumable Handcuffs
### Thrown
- Beer Can (1)
  - Generated when a Beer is consumed, or found on its own in trash cans. Thrown weapon, does minimal damage for funsies. Like a more useless Rock.
- Lunchbox (1)
  - Thrown item
  - Deals rock-level damage
  - Drops a food item on impact.
  - Alternatively, make it a melee weapon.
    - Issue with this is: say you have a lot of them on the ground. You don't want to merge them, so now you have the long task of breaking each one open.
      - Therefore, it's better as a thrown weapon since it'd allow the player to simply add the multiples to the item count and get full utility from all of them.
- Oil Bottle (1)
  - Thrown weapon that creates a splash of oil upon impact.
- Toxic Slime Capsule (1)
  - Thrown item. Inflicts poison and leaves a Goop Splash.
- Whiskey Bottle (1)
  - Generated when Whiskey is consumed, or found on its own in trash cans. Thrown weapon, does minimal damage for funsies. Like a more useless Rock.

### Trap
- Alarm Trap
- Mini Turret (3)
  - It's a Turret.
- Gas Trap
  - Made with Gas Trap kit. 
- Gas Trap Kit
  - Combine with inventory item to make a gas trap.
- Teleportation Trap (2)
  - Floor trap.
  - This also has uses for escape.

### Wearable
- Fancy Hat (3)
  - Increased chances for persuasion. Maybe a Fedora, because I want you to cringe.
- Riot Armor (3)
  - Resists bullets and melee damage.
- Riot Helmet (2)
  - Just another aesthetic option.

# Overhauls
<details>
<summary>Expand/Collapse</summary>

Any additions that include a variety of content, enough that they'd be considered sub-systems within the game.

## Alcohol

- Alcohol - Each consumption of an alcoholic beverage moves you up a tier for 60 seconds.
  - Steady - Aim improved, social %s improved
  - Tipsy - Aim reduced, object interactions slowed
  - Drunk - Melee damage resistance improved, aim horrendous, Social %s reduced, object interactions slowed further

- Trait: Lightweight
- Trait: Bar Brawler
  - Increase toughness benefits of drinking
  - Small chance of Rage
- A golden trait for the robot Alcohol Energy Source makes "alcohol into energy"
  - Drinking while already at full hp gives you some seconds in the energy level but it cannot make you go up by a level so it just gives you seconds.

## CyberWarfare
Greatly increase the possibilities, risks, rewards, and trait investment for hacking

### Ground Rules
- *Attempt*: Every action while hacking has a % chance of success displayed next to its button. 
- *System*: The collection of Objects under one Owner ID in a particular chunk that has a Computer. If there's no Computer, the object is a System unto itself.
- *Local Heat*: This is a baseline increased difficulty to all Attempts in a System. It is increased whenever you pass an Attempt, more when you fail one. Remote access leads to higher heat than using a machine in person. Some Objects when not part of a System will have their own Heat, like ATMs. Refrigerators, not so much.
- *Global Heat*: This is the overall attention given to you by the City's authorities. Every discovered intrusion raises your Global Heat, and it's much harder to lower than Local Heat.
- *Password*: Occasionally found in a Computer's owner's pocket. Might also be found hidden somewhere in a Computer. Submissive NPCs will give you their passwords. Pretty much a Safe Combo except for Computers.
- *PayData*: Questgivers will occasionally request this, which you need to retrieve from an intact Computer. Hackers will buy PayData, sometimes a better offer than completing your Quest. PayData has a small chance of appearing without a Quest attached.
- A failed Attempt in a System may have different results, depending on how much your Attempt failed by, compared to Heat:
	1. Can reattempt, Heat+.
	2. Action Locked, Heat++.
	3. Action Locked, Heat++, any Hacker owners search.
	4. Action Locked, Heat+++, triggers Alarm, owners search.
	5. System Locked, Heat++++, triggers Alarm, owners search, and a squad of Cop Bots is deployed to search for you.
	6. Computer is destroyed, triggers Alarm, owners search, and a squad of Cop Bots is deployed to search for you.

### Traits
- Tech Expert is replaced by several traits. What's not in here is covered by Explosives Expert and Mechanical Expert (separate overhauls)
- *Cyber-Intruder* - Improve your Attempt rolls.
- *Data Broker* - Increase sell price of PayData, and its chance of appearing in a System.
- *IOT God* - Enables non-Computer Object hack actions. Many of the vanilla hack actions (Like "Refrigerator Run") would be hidden behind this trait.
- *IP Ghost* - Reduces initial Heat & slows its increase.

### Generic Computer Actions
- Access PayData: Relatively difficult but valuable, so you'll probably need to make sure you're prepared.
- Access System: The initial entry to a System is technically an Attempt. This also applies if you're trying to acces a system that has been Locked.
- Lights: Turns on or off all Lights in the Chunk. (See Stealth Overhaul)
- Cut Power: Shuts down the power for the Chunk. Can be brought back up with a Generator or Power Box.
- Deactivate Alarm: Just what it sounds like.
- Enter Password: Deactivates System's Heat permanently, but you can still roll an Attempt failure!
- Guess Password: A very small chance. Feeling lucky?
- Increase Permissions: Improves success rate of all further Attempts in the system, but slightly increases your Heat.
- Invert Credentials: Immediately flip the ownership of all cameras and turrets at once.
- Maintenance Mode: Disable Heat on a target Object in the System.
- Recover Password: Very high-risk.
- Route IP: Select another computer in the vicinity to route your access through. If Cop Bots are deployed, they'll go there instead.
- Trigger Alarm: Just what it sounds like.
- Unlock Action: Unlocks most actions previously locked (Except Wipe Audits). Increases Heat substantially.
- Wipe Audit Trail: Reset's Systems Heat to 0. Can only be done once per System.

Blood Magic

Telekinesis

Charm Person
### Morphomancy
- Assume the appearance of someone else, and gain all of their relations to other NPCs

  - Miscasting turns you into a gorilla temporarily
### Necromancy

  - 3 Zombies will join your party / Turn ghosts into large number of crystals

  - Also:
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/streetsofrogue/comments/lhdwnx/my_third_entree_for_medieval_themed_characters/
### Pyromantic Jet
- Custom Firebomb explosion without glass sound
  - This was a can of worms when I tried it with HammerTime. All we need is to stop the glass sound, so maybe that'l be simpler.
- Fan of Fire 
  - 3 flames per shot 
- Fan of Fire +
  - 5 per shot
  - These should both be set to an angle proportionate to their speed. If the speed is high, keep them narrow. If it's low, keep them wide and more like a fan. They also decrease

### Telemantic Blink

  - Bring Allies

## Mugging & Extortion

  - Dealing damage to a refusing victim can make the target Submissive. 
  - Mugging is treated as a violent crime by police.
  - Mugger+ - When mugging someone, you get their inventory items too. 
- Extortionist 
  - Property owners will be more reluctant to give into extortion based on how much property they own.
  - Destruction of property and followers will make target more likely to go submissive, just like hitting them would.

## Object Tampering Extension
- Air Conditioning Unit
  - Release Gas without access to main computer 
- Button
  - Disable countdown when activated
- Generator
  - Refill Oil Can if you have Wrench
- Toilet 
  - Maybe spray water like hydrant, useful for keeping hallways clear. Or maybe some other behavior, not sure yet.
- Bed 
  - Fucking explode if someone tries to sleep in it. Not sure if they go back to bed after awoken, though.

## Rap Sheet

- Guilt
  - If there's a Computer in a Police Station, and an Annoyed or Hostile Cop stops chasing you, they'll go there and enter your information into the database. If they're successful, all cops on the level will match their attitude towards you if theirs isn't currently worse.
  - Alternatively, if any of the above are hostile when you complete a level, you will gain Wanted for the next level.
- Absolution
  - You can hack the Police Station's computer to call off the APB, restoring your relationships to the cops to normal. There should be some drawback to this.
- Fines & "Fines"
  - If a cop sees you commit a minor crime, he will become Annoyed as usual and issue a warning. You can pay a Fine with him to remove the Annoyed status.
    - Alternatively, add any cop-witnessed property damage to Cop Debt?
  - If a cop sees you commit a major crime, there is a small chance he will ask you for a bribe instead of going hostile.
- Doughnut 
  - Moderate healing if consumed
  - Give to Neutral cops to make them Friendly
  - Give to Annoyed cops to avoid paying a Fine

## Scary Guns
  - Mechanics
    - Bullets are smaller, faster & deal more damage
    - Accuracy reduced while moving, & for followup shots due to recoil
    - Chance to inflict Slow for 1-2 seconds based on weapon damage
    - Armor plays a larger role in not dying
    - Characters have higher accuracy when standing on darker tiles. 
    - Characters in brighter tiles have a slightly lower chance to be protected by cover. This includes their own muzzle flash.
  - Ranged Skill
    - Increases accuracy, particularly when moving
    - Increases ROF
    - Reduces Windup
    - NO effect on gun damage
  - Cover
    - Most furniture that used to ignore bullets can now serve as cover. This includes broken windowframes.
    - A character shooting a gun has a chance to shoot past a Cover object. This chance is determined by how close they are to the object, their Ranged skill, and the particular stats of the object (easier to shoot past a chair than a vending machine)
     	- This means that you may take Cover behind objects by staying close to them, enabling you to shoot past them.
    - Softer objects are unlikely to stop bullets, but may weaken or divert their path.
    - Cover objects have various chances of having the following effect when hit by a bullet:
      - Destruction: Object to be damaged or destroyed by bullet
      - Obstruction: Chance to be hit by a bullet if at Cover range. 
      - Slow: Slow the bullet and reduce its damage
      - Divert: Divert the path of the projectile by a few degrees. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet for variable list, pretty good info.
      - Block: Block the projectile entirely.
  - Legality:
    - Certain guns and gun mods are not legal. They will be treated as contraband by cops and cop bots. A legal gun with an illegal gun mod becomes illegal.
    - Smaller guns are able to serve as "holdouts," allowing you to conceal them from a search if you have the right trait.

### Traits 
  - Holdout Master: You can hide certain weapons from a search.

## Special Requests

Request NPCs to do special actions in a much greater variety of situations. Ask them to abuse their power, violate their principles, and cave to your threats.

### Methods

Base chances of outcome, without modifiers.

|Method				|Requirements				|Results besides compliance	|Fearful	|Hostile	|Annoyed	|Neutral	|Friendly	|Success	|
|:------------------|:--------------------------|--------------------------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
|Asking Nicely		|Relationship				|							|5			|10			|50			|5			|5			|25			|
|Bribery			|Money scaled to request	|							|0			|15			|35			|5			|0			|45			|
|Threat				|None						|Submissive					|25			|50			|10			|5			|0			|35			|

The following increase the *weighted* chance of Success above:
- Luck
- Traits (below)
- Scariness (Sum of you & followers' equipped damage vs. theirs)

The following decrease the *weighted* chance of Success above:
- Severity of request
- Security level of target chunk
- NPC type (Supercops are hard to corrupt)

- Destroying their Objects & Walls
- Damaging them and their allies

## Stealth Overhaul

- Visual detection
  - This would be an extension to Rogue Vision, or would at least carry the same rules as an assumption
  - Variable name is called "hardToSeeFromDistance", trait is same but capitalized
    - base = 1
    - Blends in Nicely or Goon = 1.7
    - Upgraded or Super-special = 2.5
  - Factors in detectable range:
    - Character Size
    - Noise
    - Light
    - Sight range (increasable with traits)
- Sound
  - Visual indicators of where sounds are coming from. This would include doors opening/closing, security cameras swiveling, etc. 
- Light
  - Hack computer to switch off lights
  - Depending on the District, lights have a chance to be flickering. More frequent in Slums, decreases as you progress.
  - Destroying a generator shuts off Lights in the Chunk? 
    - How do you handle multiple buildings per chunk, or multiple generators per building? 
      - Too bad, so sad.
- Bodies
  - Seeing a body for the first time should send other property owners into full search mode (like when an alarm goes off while hacking). 
  - Any way to keep them in a longer panic state? Finding a body should be disastrous for stealth, not a momentary setback.
  - Maybe have Alarm buttons on every level, and they run to press one if they find a body. 
    - This would need to be a mutator to ensure these are spawned.
  - If they're unconcious, they'll wake them up after searching the area
- Misc
  - Hiding in a box should slightly reduce movement speed (by like 0.5)
  - A Mirror you can use to peek around corners.
  - A Special ability that places or picks up a Spy Camera for observing patrols
  - A moveable Scout Drone
  - The ability to see Cameras' field of vision if you've hacked them, or an item specific to that.

    - Disable from Computer
    - Destroy the object and set the alarm off. 
    - Hire a Worker to tamper for you.

## Wag The Dog

The goal in this overhaul is to make winning the election a viable goal for any playstyle. In the vanilla game, getting elected requires a very narrow set of behaviors.

### Option A: Reputation Carryover

- Depending on your ending electability for a District, NPCs will have a starting attitude on later floors:

	| Reputation | Effect  |
	|:----------:|:-------:|
	| -10        | Hostile |
	| - 9 to - 5 | Annoyed |
	| - 4 to + 4 | Neutral |
	| + 5 to +10 | Friendly|
	| +10 to +15 | Loyal   |
	| +15        | Aligned |

- Affected NPCs by district:

	| District   | NPCs					|
	|:-----------|:---------------------|
	| Slums      | Gang Members			|
	| Industrial | Workers				|
	| Park		 | Gorillas, Cannibals	|
	| Downtown	 | Bouncer				|
	| Uptown	 | Upper Cruster		|

### Option B: Faction Reputations

- Same as Reputation Carryover, but influenced by behaviors

| Faction		| Members										| Enemies							|
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Blahds		| Blahds										| Crepes, Mafia, Police				|
| Crepes		| Crepes										| Blahds, Mafia, Police				|
| Mafia			| Mafia											| Crepes, Blahds, Police			|
| Police		| Police, Cop Bots, Supercops					| Crepes, Blahds, Mafia				|
| Proles		| Workers, Slum Dwellers, Clerks, Couriers		| Bourgeoisie						|
| Bourgeoisie	| Upper Crusters, Investment Bankers, Scientists| Proles							|

- Actions that affect reputation:
 - Killing members of faction and its enemies
 - Net reputation among faction at end of level

### Option C: Merge A&B, have them both active

- This would make reputation a complex thing, but still ignorable/playable by all playstyles.

## Zombie Town
- BQ: Z-Team 
  - Zombie disaster occurs every level. 
  - Kill all Zombies and all living people carrying the Z-Virus. 
  - You get a free Friend Phone per level
- Item: Z-Virus 
  - Infects anyone it touches with Z-Virus. For use in vents, pools, and water guns.
  - Extra option when Buying a Round with a bartender to give it to everyone in the bar
- Item: Z-Lixir
  - Peacefully removes Z-Virus from a non-Zombie target.
  - Can also be used in pools and vents.
- Status Effect: Z-Infected
  - Obviously most of this is already complete, but you may want additional behaviors.
  - Occasionally twitch to one direction and take 5 damage at random intervals
- Doctor
  - Interact to get Z-Lixired for a cost.

- Increase Inventory Size
  - WorldSpaceGUI.ShowNPCChest may have some good hints as to how to increase these slots.
- In Trait Menu: "Randomize Appearance" that does so and deactivates itself
- Removing traits
  - the same way you can gain + traits in the level up, there should be a chance for removing traits too (maybe called - traits?)
  - eg: You're cannibal, level up and leave slums 1. You have a choice between I'm Outtie, Low cost jobs, and - Malodorous.
- All vTraits accessible through Character Creator
- Keys, Money & Safe Combos not take up a slot
- Fortune Teller in Home Base
  - Charges Nuggets for service
  - Will give you information about your run: Disasters, traits you will be able to select on level-up, future missions, etc. 
  - It could let you get an early idea on the seed you're playing, or just help you prepare how to build your character.
  - How
    - Placing the NPC in base
      - LoadLevel.HomeBaseAgentSpawns
- Give the traits that you cannot unlock while playing an asterisk. 
  - Traits like master of disaster or tech expert for instance.

‡ Any stuff I've previously attempted but have decided not to work on for now.

- Chronomantic Dilation
  - Show Timescale in statuses
		A:	// interactingAgent.statusEffects.myStatusEffectDisplay.RefreshStatusEffectText();
			// Used as a void, just to refresh all active in list. Should be pretty simple.
			// Just make a postfix here that tacks the timescale message at the top of the list if possible.
			// However, you may need to make a new object of type StatusEffectDisplayPiece
		B:	// Might not even need a patch. First, try
			StatusEffectDisplay.AddDisplayPiece and .RemoveDisplayPiece
		C: BuffDisplay.AddStatusEffect

- General Bullet modding (Re Electromancy & others)
  - Unused variables:
    - string substance
    - int damageMod
