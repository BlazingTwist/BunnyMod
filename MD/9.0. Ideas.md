## City Overhauls

Some of these are already worked on
- Ancapistan
- FALGSC
- Police State
- Disco City Danceoff

### Battle City

  - Onlookers annoyed if you decline
- No Guns

### Fluffy Dystopia
-Random Trees and... beds? everywhere.
-Hit soud effects now sound more "squishy" like beating up a plush.
-When police brutality happens cops may say "Care-cop STARE".
-Theres no blood its instead.... uh idk stuffing.
-Most floors then to be stuff like carpets.
-Beer is changed to "soda" and whisky is changed to "apple juice".

### Freak City
- Maximize supernatural and bizarre
- 
### Luddite City
- No technology

## CyberWarfare
Greatly increase the possibilities, risks, rewards, and trait investment for hacking

### Ground Rules
- *Access Level*
  - Determines what actions you have access to in a System.
  - Reduce heat for lower-AL actions
  - Starting Access level depends on chunk
  - For simplicity (LOL), set this to Guest, User, and Admin
- *Attempt*
  - Any action taken while hacking (See Actions sections below)
  - Has a % chance of success displayed next to its button.
  - A failed Attempt in a System may have different results, depending on how much your Attempt failed by, compared to Heat:

|Attempt Failure Tier   |Lock   |Heat   |Alarm  |Search Chunk   |Deploy     |Other  |
|:---------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------------:|:---------:|:------|
|Invalid Entry          |-      |+      |N      |-              |-          |
|Access Denied          |Action |++     |N      |-              |-          |
|Admins Notified        |Action |++     |N      |Hacker Owners  |-          |
|Breach Detected        |Action |+++    |Y      |Owners         |-          |
|Emergency Mode         |System |++++   |Y      |Owners         |Cop Bots   |
|Red Alert              |System |++++   |Y      |Owners         |Cop Bots   |Computer self-destructs

- *System*
  - *Chunk System*
    - All Objects under one Owner ID in a particular chunk that has a Computer. 
  - *Faction System* 
    - Al Objects under a Faction-type Agent (Cops, Mafia, Gangsters, etc.)
  - *Object System*
    - If there's no Computer in the Chunk, the object is a System unto itself.
    - ATMs will have intrusion countermeasures. Refrigerators probably won't.
  - *Global System*
    - All Systems everywhere. Call it The Grid.
    - This would be accessible from certain chunks only, like Power Stations or Mayor's Office.
- *Heat*
    - Baseline increased difficulty to all Attempts in a System, which persists as long as that System exists. 
      - So the Global and Faction systems (and your Heat therein) will persist between floors, but a Chunk or Object system will cease to exist when you use an Elevator.
    - Increased whenever you make an Attempt:
      - Slightly for Success
      - More for Failure
      - Scaled to severity of action in terms of system security
    - Remote access leads to higher Heat than using a machine in person. 
- *Notoriety*
  - Overall attention given to you by the City's authorities, hacker groups, and others. 
- *Password*
  - Occasionally found in a Computer's owner's pocket, Safe, etc. 
  - Might also be found hidden somewhere in a Computer. 
  - Submissive NPCs will give you their passwords. 
  - Pretty much a Safe Combo except for Computers.
  - Using a Password will increase your Access level and/or raise your Heat.
- *PayData*
  - Found in Computers, simply has value to the right buyer.
  - Questgivers will occasionally request this, which you need to retrieve from an intact Computer. 
  - Selling PayData
    - Option 1: Digital
      - While paydata is selected you can "sell through email" letting you send it to the computer of any chunk of the floor (while the owner is interested in that data).
      - Safer method
    - Option 2: Physical
      - If you have a floppy disks (item that can be looted from offices or places like that) you can use it on the computer to get the info exported to it, then it becomes a labeled floppy disks that can be sold. alternative certain paydatas can be printed into important documents using the EVIL DCP-L2540DW PRINTER, again to be sold.
      - NPCs will buy PayData, sometimes a better offer than completing your Quest. 
      - Custom NPC Data Broker will buy all kinds.
  - PayData has a small chance of appearing without a Quest attached.
  - Type 
    - Will determine who's interested in buying it.
    - Type generated according to chunk

|PayData Type           |Buyer(s)                       |Chunk(s)   |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------|:----------|
|Blueprints             |Thief, Resistance Leader       |

### NPC Interactions
Hackers might serve a special role in this system, serving as general protectors of their Systems. Either that, or a new NPC type for a less grey-hat computer person.

Interacting with such NPC should have certain options, like threatening for Admin passwords, etc. That would all depend on what the hacking system itself looks like.

## Disaster Solutions

Whenever a Disaster occurs, you can meet certain conditions to address it. Doing so causes the condition to stop occurring, and gives a large XP bonus and reputation boost.

## Drug Overhaul
Make syringes all have complex effects, and give them drug names. Adds character, increases uses.

Add addiction dynamics specific to each drug.

## Gambling
Make gambling a viable partial playstyle. More opportunities to gamble and cheat, and deepen mechanics.

### Big Quests
- Gambling Addiction
  - Win a certain amount of money gambling

### Items
- Weighted Dice
  - Improve Street craps odds

### Mechanics
- On any simulated games like Poker, Alcohol reduces your luck

### NPC Interactions
- Arena
  - Instead of entering yourself, you can choose to bet on a fight.
    - Doing so spawns a "Wildcard" fighter with random stats.
    - You might get an option between three names with odds indicated
- Casino
  - Clerk
    - Play Blackjack
    - Play Poker (single-player variant)
  - Bartender
    - Gives you a free drink when you're doing well
  - Goon
    - Asks you to leave if you're doing too well. Slot Machines no longer deactivate on their own.
- Streets
  - Most Slum NPCs
    - Play Street Craps

### Traits
- [Name]
  - Like Addict but with gambling
- Gambling Addiction
  - This would require an extension to gamble with Roamers
- Pound of Flesh
  - No money? You can use Slot machines with HP instead.
- Hard Crapper
  - Can play Street craps with anyone Neutral or better
    - Street Craps Rules
        1. Players must first identify the player who will be shooting dice – the shooter. The shooter will then need to make a bet followed by the rest of the group in the clockwise direction. Each player can cover a portion of or all of the shooter’s bet. Betting continues until the shooter’s wager is matched.
        2. The come out roll comes next. This is the game’s first roll and it could end the game if it is a 7, 11, 2, 3 or 12. The shooter and any other player who bet in favor of the shooter win the game if a 7 or 11 is rolled. If a 2, 3 or 12 come up when the dice are rolled the shooter and other players who bet for him lose.
        3. A Point number, which is a number other than those mentioned above, must be set up. So if the come out roll is not any of those numbers listed above that number will be designated as the point number.
        4. The roll is next and the goal is for the shooter to roll the number identified as the point before he rolls a 7. The 7 is referred to an “Out 7” and once the shooter gets this before rolling the point he loses the game.
        5. Rolling dice proceeds until a 7 or the Point is rolled. The shooter loses if the 7 comes up and wins if the Point is rolled. If other numbers are rolled the shooter continues rolling the dice. The round ends only after a 7 or the point is rolled.
        6. It is important that you remember that all bets should be made before the come out roll and you will only win what you bet. As you can see the street craps rules are very similar to rules of casino craps.

## Junk Weapons

Destroying items makes usable melee or thrown weapons.

As these aren't designed for combat, their durability is very low and generally spawns below 100. They're here to make combat a little more dynamic and unpredictable - you'll rarely be caught without something to use, but so will enemies.

- Fan of Fire 
  - 3 flames per shot 
- Fan of Fire +
  - 5 per shot
  - These should both be set to an angle proportionate to their speed. If the speed is high, keep them narrow. If it's low, keep them wide and more like a fan. They also decrease

## Rap Sheet - General Police Overhaul

- Guilt
  - If there's a Computer in a Police Station, and an Annoyed or Hostile Cop stops chasing you, they'll go there and enter your information into the database. If they're successful, all cops on the level will match their attitude towards you if theirs isn't currently worse.
  - Alternatively, if any of the above are hostile when you complete a level, you will gain Wanted for the next level.
- Absolution
  - You can hack the Police Station's computer to call off the APB, restoring your relationships to the cops to normal. There should be some drawback to this.
- Fines & "Fines"
  - If a cop sees you commit a minor crime, he will become Annoyed as usual and issue a warning. You can pay a Fine with him to remove the Annoyed status.
    - Alternatively, add any cop-witnessed property damage to Cop Debt?
  - If a cop sees you commit a major crime, there is a small chance he will ask you for a bribe instead of going hostile.
- Doughnut 
  - Moderate healing if consumed
  - Give to Neutral cops to make them Friendly
  - Give to Annoyed cops to avoid paying a Fine
- Less-Lethal Means
  - Some cops carry Tasers that they don't drop
  - Cops will arrest you in some situations (Stunned or surrender), sending you to jail.
    - How do you get out? 
      - Cellmate
        - Thief - buy (or take) a lockpick
        - Drug Dealer - OD as a distraction
        - Etc
      - No Cellmate
        - Resistance Leader comes and breaks you out
- Cops revive others knocked out

## Scary Guns
  - Mechanics
    - Bullets are smaller, faster & deal more damage
    - Accuracy reduced while moving, & for followup shots due to recoil
    - Chance to inflict Slow for 1-2 seconds based on weapon damage
    - Armor plays a larger role in not dying
    - Characters have higher accuracy when standing on darker tiles. 
    - Characters in brighter tiles have a slightly lower chance to be protected by cover. This includes their own muzzle flash.
  - Ranged Skill
    - Increases accuracy, particularly when moving
    - Increases ROF
    - Reduces Windup
    - NO effect on gun damage
  - Cover
    - Most furniture that used to ignore bullets can now serve as cover. This includes broken windowframes.
    - A character shooting a gun has a chance to shoot past a Cover object. This chance is determined by how close they are to the object, their Ranged skill, and the particular stats of the object (easier to shoot past a chair than a vending machine)
     	- This means that you may take Cover behind objects by staying close to them, enabling you to shoot past them.
    - Softer objects are unlikely to stop bullets, but may weaken or divert their path.
    - Cover objects have various chances of having the following effect when hit by a bullet:
      - Destruction: Object to be damaged or destroyed by bullet
      - Obstruction: Chance to be hit by a bullet if at Cover range. 
      - Slow: Slow the bullet and reduce its damage
      - Divert: Divert the path of the projectile by a few degrees. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet for variable list, pretty good info.
      - Block: Block the projectile entirely.
  - Legality:
    - Certain guns and gun mods are not legal. They will be treated as contraband by cops and cop bots. A legal gun with an illegal gun mod becomes illegal.
    - Smaller guns are able to serve as "holdouts," allowing you to conceal them from a search if you have the right trait.

## Silver Tongue - Special Requests for NPCs

Request NPCs to do special actions in a much greater variety of situations. Ask them to abuse their power, violate their principles, and cave to your threats.

### Methods of Requesting

Base chances of outcome, without modifiers.

|Request			|Requirements + % roll  	|Results besides compliance	|Fearful	|Hostile	|Annoyed	|Neutral	|Friendly	|Success	|
|:------------------|:--------------------------|--------------------------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
|Asking Nicely		|Relationship				|							|5			|10			|50			|5			|5			|25			|
|Bribery			|Money scaled to request	|							|0			|15			|35			|5			|0			|45			|
|Threat				|None						|Submissive					|25			|50			|10			|5			|0			|35			|

The following increase the *weighted* chance of Success above:
- Luck
- Traits (below)
- Scariness (Sum of you & followers' equipped damage vs. theirs)

The following decrease the *weighted* chance of Success above:
- Severity of request
- Security level of target chunk
- NPC type (Supercops are hard to corrupt) 

- SOME failed checks that result in Hostility can be resolved by making the NPC submissive (A la Extortionist) via:
  - Destroying their Objects & Walls
  - Damaging them and their allies
- Making an NPC submissive 

- NPC reactions to failed Requests are based on Threat and NPC type:
  - Fight to death
  - Fight until beaten, then flee
  - Alarm Button if applicable
  - Fight until beaten, then Submissive

## Stealth Overhaul
- Player Vision
  - Hacking a Security Camera or its attached computer gives you the vision range of the cameras.
    - Add bool playerCanSeeVisionPerm and playerCanSeeVisionTemp
    - Patch into PlayfieldObject.RogueVisionCheck to iterate within objects where this is enabled
  - Trait that allows peeking around corners, somehow? I don't think I have the programming chops for that. But maybe the trick would be making the player technically hidden if partially occluded by a wall.
  - Item for looking around corners
  - Item for looking through closed doors
- NPC Vision
  - This would be an extension to Rogue Vision, or would at least carry the same rules as an assumption
  - Variable name is called "hardToSeeFromDistance", trait is same but capitalized
    - base = 1
    - Blends in Nicely or Goon = 1.7
    - Upgraded or Super-special = 2.5
  - Factors in detectable range:
    - Character Size
    - Noise
    - Light
    - Sight range (increasable with traits)
  - Trait: Predator Vision
    - All NPCs have Sight Lines like the cop bots. You can see these even if they're obscured.
- Player Hearing
  - Visual indicators of where sounds are coming from. This would include doors opening/closing, security cameras swiveling, etc. 
- NPC Hearing
  - Certain objects cause constant noise causing people to hear less from things close to it and viceversa
    - Buildings that make noise by nature: 
      - Arcade (kinda loud)
      - Bar (not loud but not silent)
      - Broadcasting Station (somewhat loud)
      - Casino (loud)
      - Dance Club (REALLY LOUD so sounds from the outside are pretty much silenced or muffled)
      - Movie Theater (loud)
      - Music Hall (loud)
    - Objects that make noise by nature: 
      - Arcade Game
      - Speaker

  - Destroying a generator shuts off Lights in the Chunk? 
    - How do you handle multiple buildings per chunk, or multiple generators per building? 
      - Too bad, so sad.
- Bodies
  - Seeing a body for the first time should send other property owners into full search mode (like when an alarm goes off while hacking). 
  - Any way to keep them in a longer panic state? Finding a body should be disastrous for stealth, not a momentary setback.
  - Maybe have Alarm buttons on every level, and they run to press one if they find a body. 
    - This would need to be a mutator to ensure these are spawned.
  - If they're unconcious, they'll wake them up after searching the area
- Misc
  - Deactivate Agent.RogueLight ?
    - Reactivate if they have Flashlight item
    - Shape it like a flashlight, duh
  - Hiding in a box should slightly reduce movement speed (by like 0.5)
  - A Mirror you can use to peek around corners.
  - A Special ability that places or picks up a Spy Camera for observing patrols
  - A moveable Scout Drone
  - The ability to see Cameras' field of vision if you've hacked them, or an item specific to that.
- Items
  - Tracker Dart
    - Shoot an enemy with it to set a visible tracking ping wherever they go
  - Spy Cam
    - Throwable
    - Not noticed until NPC very close
  - Spy Drone
    - Activate to create a Mind-Controlled robot with Diminutive & Roller Skates<br>- Cannot attack or interact, but also can't be seen by enemies<br>- Designed for Rogue Vision

## Wag The Dog - Reputation & Factions

The goal in this overhaul is to make winning the election a viable goal for any playstyle. In the vanilla game, getting elected requires a very narrow set of behaviors.

### Option A: Reputation Carryover

Depending on your ending electability for a District, certain NPC types will have a starting attitude on later floors:

| Reputation | Effect  |
|:----------:|:-------:|
| -10        | Hostile |
| - 9 to - 5 | Annoyed |
| - 4 to + 4 | Neutral |
| + 5 to +10 | Friendly|
| +10 to +15 | Loyal   |
| +15        | Aligned |

Affected NPCs by district:

| District   | NPCs					|
|:-----------|:---------------------|
| Slums      | Gang Members			|
| Industrial | Workers				|
| Park		 | Gorillas, Cannibals	|
| Downtown	 | Bouncer				|
| Uptown	 | Upper Cruster		|

### Option B: Faction Reputations

- Same as Reputation Carryover, but influenced by behaviors

| Faction		| Members										| Rivals							|
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Blahds		| Blahds										| Crepes, Mafia, Police				|
| Crepes		| Crepes										| Blahds, Mafia, Police				|
| Mafia			| Mafia											| Crepes, Blahds, Police			|
| Police		| Police, Cop Bots, Supercops					| Crepes, Blahds, Mafia				|
| Proletariat   | Workers, Slum Dwellers, Clerks, Couriers		| Bourgeoisie						|
| Bourgeoisie	| Upper Crusters, Investment Bankers, Scientists| Proletariat						|

- Actions that affect reputation:
  - Killing members of faction and its enemies
  - Net reputation among faction at end of level

### Option C: Merge A&B, have them both active

- This would make reputation a complex thing, but still ignorable/playable by all playstyles.

## Zombie Town
- Big Quest: Z-Team 
  - Zombie disaster occurs every level. 
  - Kill all Zombies and all living people carrying the Z-Virus. 
  - You get a free Friend Phone per level
- Item: Z-Virus 
  - Infects anyone it touches with Z-Virus. For use in vents, pools, and water guns.
  - Extra option when Buying a Round with a bartender to give it to everyone in the bar
- Item: Z-Lixir
  - Peacefully removes Z-Virus from a non-Zombie target.
  - Can also be used in pools and vents.
- Status Effect: Z-Infected
  - Obviously most of this is already complete, but you may want additional behaviors.
  - Occasionally twitch to one direction and take 5 damage at random intervals
- Doctor
  - Interact to get Z-Lixired for a cost.
