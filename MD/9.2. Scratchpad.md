# Scratchpad - Usually trial & error notes

- Affecting security item spawn chances
  - SpawnerObject.spawn, seek "SpawnChance" OR BasicObject.spawn, seek "SpawnChance"
    - These will *certainly* work, they're just a lot harder to mod than RandomOther.FillOther
  - PFO.spawnChanceSpecial specifically refers to security items having variable spawns

- Eagle Eyes
  - NPC activity range needs to be increased
  - Reduce UI scale
- Polarizing
  - No effect
- Polarizing + 
  - Only Annoyed or Friendly
- Priors
  - No effect
    - This can be directly modelend on Wanted, to ensure completeness of the mod.
  - Ensure all law enforcement follow suit
- Reinforcements
  - Change unit type
- Reinforcements + 
  - No equipment
- Rushin' Revolution
  - Open elevator
- Stealth Bastard Deluxe
  - Hide in Trashcans if you have Diminutive
  - Add: Can open/close doors silently, if that's not covered by sneaky fingers
- TamperTantrum
  - Amended some apparent errors and clarified some names. Removed ref from arguments, seemed unnecessary .Test.
- Underdark Citizen
  - Make manholes generate in every district.
  - Throwable Manhole cover?
- Voucher Rewards
  - RandomItems.fillItems, line 336
- Wall Mods
  - If SpawnerFloor.spawn works out for floors, you might have a parallel solution for floors in SpawnerWall.spawn
    - Specifically I'm referring to stubborn hideout walls.
  - Disable Fire Spewers in Shanty Town & Green Living, or turn them into something else like Cameras.
- Warlord
  - No effect

- Trait conflicts not working right

        ```  
        Abbysssal — 
        Available determines whether a trait will exist in the game. IsActive determines whether that trait will appear in the game (can be toggled on/off in the Traits Menu at Home Base).
        I think you should just patch StatusEffects.GetUpgradeTraits
        ```


## General notes

- RandomSelection.LoadRandomness is a good place to find lists to modify

# Finalization
- Do renames *only when the code is complete*.
- Complete and win a run with each new feature, and successfully load a return to home base. This would be a full cycle of the code you can expect to run into.
- Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.
- Update Sprites
- Increment the Version Number!
