# Scratchpad
- Add this to each class, and distribute it.
```
     public static GameController gc => GameController.gameController;
```

- Underdark Citizen
  - Make manholes generate in every district.
    - I might be modding specifically Custom Levels. See if there's another way to add level features.
      - It's possible these don't generate randomly. See how other scattered objects are generated.

# Implementations

## Mutators
- Do not do Zoom Levels here, those are traits.
- Mafia spawn on all levels (Request)
  - Would be extremely easy, just set LevelData.levelFeatures.Contains("Mafia") to true
- District-related spawns
  - LevelEditor.CreateLevelFeatureList
- Let Me See That Throng
  - Multiply number of roamers by ~4
- Bad Air Quality
  - No Roamers
- Return to Shrunke
  - Everyone in the city is Shrunken. 
- Large Maps
- No NPC Tethers

## Object Interactions
- Air Conditioning Unit
  - Release Gas without access to main computer 
  - Uses Wrench, 10s countdown
- Bed 
  - Fucking explode if someone tries to sleep in it. Not sure if they go back to bed after awoken, though.
- Safe 
  - Open with Detonator.
- Stove
  - Raise countdown to 10s from 5s, just to match. I like 5s but we should defer to vanilla choices in this case.
- Vendor Stand
  - Activate to steal. It has a progress bar and is eligible for sneaky fingers, nimble fingers, & Promise I'll Return it
  - Needs to alert police

## Traits
- Update Ideas file to include any Traits you've made Placeholders for (commented out)
---
- Alcoholic - Might be interesting to have an Addict trait but with alcohol.
- Door Kicker - Activate a Door and select "Kick". Door is instantly destroyed, and anyone standing behind it is stunned. SWAT shit!
- Underdark Citizen 
  - Use crowbar to open a manhole
  - Activate an open Manhole to jump out of another one
  - People will not attack you from manholes
  - Manholes spawn in all districts
- One Happy Tamper - Tamper without angering Owner (Or just extend this into Clumsiness Forgiven)
- Trapper Keeper - You can Interact with traps to add them to your inventory (Bear Traps, Land Mines). 100% chance to deactivate Door Detonators.
- Trait: Beggar 
  - Works like Mugging, but lower-stakes.
- Zoom Levels

# Finalization
- Do renames *only when the code is complete*.
- Complete and win a run with each new feature, and successfully load a return to home base. This would be a full cycle of the code you can expect to run into.
- Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.
- Update Sprites
- Increment the Version Number!
