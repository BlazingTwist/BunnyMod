These are my test notes. Feel free to look if you're curious about what I'm working on.

# Scratchpad

GC.CanalHoles might be a fun thing to switch to positive. Downtown becomes a Skyway district?

## Mutators

- Overhauls
  - Redo how you did it in LoadLevel.CanUseChunk to ensure balanced distribution of chunks

- AnCapistan
  - Objects
    - Toilets cost money
    - Elevators cost money
    - Bathtubs cost money
    - Fire Hydrants cost money
  - NPCs
    - Firefighters
      - Only respond to fires in certain chunk types
    - More Thieves
    - More Drug Dealers
    - More Slum Dwellers
    - No Police, Cop Bots, or SuperCops
    - Upper Crusters 
      - Roam with bodyguards
      - Fewer in number
      - All aligned to each other
  - Re-enable Alarm buttons & Police boxes, but make them paid
  - Re-enable fire hydrants, but make them paid
  - Purchase Admin access on all computers
- Floor Mods
  - Attempted
    - Didn't work
      - SpawnerFloor.Spawn looks like the right place, but you need a full replacement.
        - Converted and refactored. Used __instance.transform instead of base, may need to replace that.
- Flammable Walls remove Fire Spewer
  - Attempted
    - Seemed to work, but no new security cams. That's acceptable, but verify their name.
- Police State
  - Enable/Disable chunk types appropriate (like deportation centers)
    - Attempted
  - Police start Annoyed/2 Strikes
    - Attempted
  - Police hostile to all Guilty NPCs
  - Upper Cruster changes similar to AnCapistan
  - ALL cameras trigger anytime someone guilty is seen, even in public tiles
  - Thieves, Drug Dealers, Mafia & Gangbangers don't roam levels
- Wall Mods
  - If SpawnerFloor.spawn works out for floors, you might have a parallel solution for floors in SpawnerWall.spawn
    - Specifically I'm referring to stubborn hideout walls.

## Traits

- General Relationship traits
  - Set a gate to exclude the Home Base
  - Maybe also exclude resistance leaders etc.

- Eagle Eyes
  - NPC activity range needs to be increased
  - Reduce UI scale
    - CanvasScaler.m_ScaleFactor
    - MainGUI.ShowInterfaceAnim
      - This also includes Inventory menus
        - InvSlot.TotalSlotNumber
- Priors
  - No effect
    - This can be directly modelend on Wanted, to ensure completeness of the mod.
  - Ensure all law enforcement follow suit
- Reinforcements/ Reinforcements + 
  - Weapons are empty
  - Weapons sometimes not equipped
  - Will not defend themselves, just stand there
- Stealth Bastard Deluxe
  - Hide in Trashcans if you have Diminutive
  - Add: Can open/close doors silently, if that's not covered by sneaky fingers
    - Attempted
      - They now appear to be closed when open. Technically work correctly, but showing wrong sprite.
- TamperTantrum
  - Amended some apparent errors and clarified some names. Removed ref from arguments, seemed unnecessary .Test.
    - Yep, now it's incrementing it by an incorrect amount. Showed -7, incremented -15.
- Underdark Citizen
  - Make manholes generate in every district.
    - I think there might be a LevelTheme check in here somewhere
      - These spawn in all districts with MixedUpDistricts, check where that takes effect.
        - Manhole.Start attempted
          - No luck there
    - Verify which feature generation script you're basing UD Manholes on. It didn't appear to be the vanilla Manhole used as a model in LoadLevel.
      - Please note that you put the vanilla generation in an "else" statement, and it looks like none of the other features are generating anymore. 
  - Throwable Manhole cover?
- Warlord
  - No effect

- RogueLibs conflicts not working right

```  
Abbysssal — 
Available determines whether a trait will exist in the game. 
IsActive determines whether that trait will appear in the game (can be toggled on/off in the Traits Menu at Home Base).
I think you should just patch StatusEffects.GetUpgradeTraits
```

## General notes

- RandomSelection.LoadRandomness is a good place to find lists to modify

# Implementation Slate

# Fixes

# Balancing

# Finalization
- Do renames *only when the code is complete*.
- Complete and win a run with each new feature, and successfully load a return to home base. This would be a full cycle of the code you can expect to run into.
- Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.
- Update Sprites
- Increment the Version Number!

## Release Notes 

- New Mutators: Shanty Town & City of Steel
- New Traits: Eagle Eyes, Eagle Eyes +, Myopic, Ultramyopic, Underdark Citizen
