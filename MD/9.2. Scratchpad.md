## Afraid of Loud Noises
- if a silenced weapon runs out and the next one to be selected is too loud, it'll keep clicking the triggeron the quiet gun because it can't switch. Instead it should skip the loud one and switch to a quiet weapon even if out of order.

  - CameraScript.RealAwake
## Floor Mods
- Interiors (BasicFloor.Spawn)
  - Detect edge cases that you never want to replace. Graveyards are turning into the chosen type.
    - These could also be set by Chunk type, maybe.
- Conflicts with Wall mods, remove those
- Try for Exterior [DO NOT DELETE any attempts here, there are a *ton* of places to attempt]

## Manhole
- Walkover version of flushyourself:

        - This only occurred when no other manholes were open. There were active toilets.
        - Walkover version also only sends to self.
        - One manhole keeps getting excluded. Check that the random selection from lists isn't excluding anything from the running.
## Priors
- Add small chance for human LEOs to start Hostile, not just annoyed. They're cops who know you too well.
## Slot Machine
- Jackpot
  - Split into hack & non-hack versions
    - Attempted
  - Still need to gate some sound effects, but after test
  - Played 100, It dropped Money(0)
  - Check out the algorithm, something is off. Odds are much worse but payouts aren't higher.
## Sniper
- Restrict to Revolver
  - Attempted
    - DW
- Non-collision with hiddenIn object
  - Find bullet collision with object method, and except it if it's that object.
    - DW
- This is just occurring for all guns, if they're far away. make sure the ifs/ands are correct checking for the trait.
  - I think the new trait checking function might always be returning true...
## Spelunky Dory
- Cave outcroppings
  - Ensure They adjoin Cave Walls only, there should be enough example algos in that method to demonstrate how to do it.
  - Change from Altar to Wall
    - Attempted
- Can't generate specifically cave wall??
## Stealth Bastard Deluxe
- Open Doors Silently
  - Attempted: Patched Door.Unlock
  - May want to check out Relationships.OwnCheck, or where and when it's called in these methods.
- Hide Offset adjustment
  - Works well for Plant on North & South
  - Big Table doesn't work at all
    - Accepted
  - Northwall Bathtub bounces out
  - PoolTable
    - No offset?
  - Trash Can
    - Guessing South
- Transforms are not restoring
## Trait Conflict custom method 
- Add series of strings and Lists of strings
- Exclude self, give self as argument
- Trait conlficts are Unlock.cancellations
- Would be a good contribution to RL3

# Balancing
Implemented and Bugfixed features that need balancing before release.

---

## Telemancy
- Miscast chance with Wild Casting is way too high, or not accurate enough.
- Reduce or at least randomize Dizzy duration. Guessing 5s instead of 10s.


#
# Finalization
- Do renames *only when the code is complete*.
- Complete and win a run with each new feature, and successfully load a return to home base. This would be a full cycle of the code you can expect to run into.
- Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.
- Update Sprites
- Increment the Version Number!

## Release Notes 

- New Mutators
- New Object Interactions
- New Traits

# Shelved
Out-of-scope features and notes for them; any bugs not worth fixing yet; avenues for codebase exploration

---

- AccessTools argument additions (new Type[1] {etc} often missing)
  - Slot machine may have been addressed

- RandomSelection.LoadRandomness is a good place to find lists to modify 

- RogueLibs conflicts not working right
    ```  
    Abbysssal — 
    Available determines whether a trait will exist in the game. 
    IsActive determines whether that trait will appear in the game (can be toggled on/off in the Traits Menu at Home Base).
    I think you should just patch StatusEffects.GetUpgradeTraits
    ```

- Targetable Items
  - InvItem.OperateItem appears to be near the beginning of this chain
    - Goes all the way down to ObjectReal.LaptopHack

  - Buy fake pass from Fixer

    - It is possible that SecurityCam has Snap-To-Wall behaviors built-in that Trashcans don't. 
      - Try removing this algorithm's snap-to-wall portions in order to not interrupt the Camera's code from doing its thing.
    - Postfixed SetVars with `shiftAmountS = -0.16f`
      - Didn't work
  - I think I get this algorithm now: the original spot they're locating is the blank between two placed trashcans. That's why you often see them right next to each other with a gap in between.
    - So you can probably greatly simplify this algorithm to just use the spot in the middle.
- The Law
  - This would be a whole different playstyle here, wouldn't it?
  - No removal of Wanted if you fuck up this badly. You're now persona non grata.

## Overhauls

These are all accessed via the Mutators menu. These affect large swathes of gameplay content.

### AnCapistan
This just makes the game act like normal life in America. By the way, it's polite to *leave a tip* when someone mugs you.
