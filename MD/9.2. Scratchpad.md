# Scratchpad
These are my test notes. Feel free to look around if you're curious about what I'm working on.

- Entered arena fight, and when I entered the arena I got this:
    - [Error  : Unity Log] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
        Stack trace:

- Used public turntables, spun records, got fail noise, and this:

```

- Used Police Radio on someone, they just followed them and didn't go hostile

- Started a run with Green Living & Arcology, and it seemed that wall ownership got broken. 
  - All owned doors in one base showed "open/knock/done" prompt, even inside doors
  - Door knocking worked fine, but most would not flee a building if it was burning. 
  - So my best guess is that the affected walls' owner is getting cleared out somewhere.

#
# Implementation
Features for the current update designated to be within scope.

---

- Had option to pay cops even if I had already done it (did it in person though, not at machine)
## Bodyguarded/ +

  - ObjectRealOnCamera
    - Attempted
  - BrainUpdate.RogueVisionChecks()

- Might be one place using Instance instead of Base. Only non-routine thing done there.
- 
## Fountain
- Can't steal after tossed coin
## Features
- Add all to MixedUpEnvironments
- Add all new ones to Feature list
## Fountain
- Loot coins
  - Annoys passersby
    - Only did one, make sure it applies to all in range
## Gang Tats
- Make compatible With Suspicious
## Headshots
- Add: Headgear reduces damage
## Litter & Leaves
- Overflow indoors
  - Check for wall and don't go past it
- Add Butler Bots to Uptown & MV
  - They generated at the entrance, but stayed put.
- Main generator should not avoid confined spaces, since it can't block anything. I.e., why is it not spawning in alleys?
  - Attempted: modified argument to FindRandLocationGeneral
- Specific executions:
  - ATM
  - Barbecue
    - Bring in slightly and slightly reduce quantity
      - Attempted
  - Boulder (large)
    - Bring in & reduce quantity slightly
      - Attempted
  - BoulderSmall
    - Ok?
  - Bush
    - Ok?
  - Flaming Barrels
    - These are still *really* spread out. Is there a built-in spread?
  - Goodie Dispenser
    - Add Vendor Cart parts
  - Hedge Walls
    - Attempted, BasicWall.Spawn
  - Killer Plant
    - Ok?
  - Tree
    - Ok?
## Initial Relationship
- Whatever you changed in this seemed to have broken it.
  - Ideological Clash turned people hostile but they didn't act it. 
    - Verify that you're not inappropriately referencing the not-yet-applied stored relationship variable to determine strikes. I think someone who would be Hostile is being set to neutral strikes.
## Mob Debt
- Per level: Annoyed from Level 1 / Hostile from level 5 / hit squads after Level 10
  - Attempted
- Extra xp for killing mobsters
  - Attempted. StatusEffects.AgentIsRival
## Mook Masher / Mob Debt
- Make them guilty in case you have The Law
  - Attempted
## Mutator List Collapsers (Copy ATOM)
- Attempted
## Objectively Unpleasant
- Some starting out hostile but not acting it. Also had The Law when I did this so not sure if it's a unique interaction.
## Objectively Unpleasant + vanilla Ideological Clash
- Hostiles were generated, but they weren't hostile.
  - Attempted adding Strikes
## PoliceBox
- Owncheck with normal cops not working on tamper?
## Priors
- Hostile cops don't act hostile
  - Attempted: Set Strikes
- Makes cops annoyed so you can't pay them off.
  - Attempted: Allowed bribe through ATM with Priors
## Public Security Cams + Turrets
- Align with Cops in conflict, regardless of settings
- Randomize direction for Panoptikopolis if attached to glass wall?
- Use Alarm Button / Police Box detection/ownership rules to align with police
  - Attempted
- Detect Guilty/Wanted
  - Add buttons from hack with indicators to check status. Or just log when Agent interacts with it.
    - Attempted
  - This:
      - [Message: Bunny Mod] SecurityCam_Interact_Temporary
        [Message: Bunny Mod]    Name:   SecurityCam (2288)
        [Message: Bunny Mod]    Owner:  85
        [Message: Bunny Mod]    Targets:        NonOwners
        [Message: Bunny Mod]    Turrets#:       0
        [Message: Bunny Mod] ObjectReal_Interact: SecurityCam (2288)
        [Message: Bunny Mod] Player Agent detected on Camera
        [Message: Bunny Mod]    OwnerID:        0
        [Message: Bunny Mod]    AgentsInView:   0   
- Attach to Turret
  - set securityType == "Turret"
    - Attempted
  - set SecurityCam.turrets to include paired turret
    - Attempted
- Special hacking rules for public cams will be necessary
  - If owner=42069 & agent is cop, that'll work
- Owncheck on tamper working?
- Add Tamper XP if PoliceState
  - Attempted
- Set ownership
  - At least one didn't work, I think it was set to the owner of its attached wall.
## Reuse Base Methods called with AccessTools
- If there are base methods you use again and again, declare them in the class to save space and increase clarity, avoiding AccessTools mess.
  - One example is PlayfieldObject.DetermineButtons, which is used in every derived class from it.
## Security Cam & other objects
- Enable to start back on if deactivated via hack
## Slot Machine
- Non-Jackpot
  - Make "Win" ding number of times of multiplier for normal wins
    - Attempted
      - I don't think this will be right, because you need an Async task for it
- Make an Owner come and tell the winner they're cut off, but give them a free drink
  - This would be good to shelve for when you do a full gambling update.
- Jackpot
  - No longer shuts down other machines in chunk
  - Keeps showing music note (I think particle effect) after jackpot ended
    - __instance.stateIndicator.STtateIndicatorOff();
  - No dialogue
- Gate shutdown behind !NoLimits
  - Attempted
## Sniper +
- Shooting from hidden object
  - Attempted with BulletHitbox.OnTriggerEnter2D
    - DW, but see what logs are saying before deletion
- Check out vTrait.BulletsPassThroughObjects. It's in BulletHitBox.HitObject
- Consider Bullet.RayHit
- Model this one on Penetrating Bullets: BulletHitbox.HitObject
  - Attempted 
    - (If this doesn't work, try with eliminating BulletHitBox.OnTriggerEnter2d patch next)
- PFO.bulletsCanPass may determine raycast end of bullet
- Give some visual indicator, either as a SPecial Indicator over NPCs, or a color change on the aiming reticle, when you are able to do a headshot
- Ability Indicator at Range
  - May need to trigger StatusEffects.SpecialAbilityInterfaceCheck as if adding a Special Ability. Not sure this will be doable with a trait.
    - Call it in AddTrait.
  - Attempted
    - StatusEffect.AddTrait
    - StatusEffects.SpecialAbilityInterfaceCheck
    - Used placeholder Chloroform sprite
    - Used placeholder range without 2f range mod from hiding
## Stealth Bastard Deluxe
- Hide Offset adjustment
  - Plant
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - Big Table 
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - BathTub
    - South doesn't seem to work at least when it's not shoved to a north wall, bounces out.
    - This was the original one with the weird trapping collider with North.
    - So it looks like you need to detect whether it's pushed north, and do South then. Otherwise do North.
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - PoolTable
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - Trash Can
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - Play different audio when you hide in other stuff
    - Trash Can - ManholeOpen
    - Tables - Tumble/Fall
- Check out StatusEffects_BecomeNotHidden_Prefix
  - __instance.agent.hiddenInObject.objectCollider.enabled can be set to false for any that are especially stubborn with trapping players.
## Stove
- Allow remote hack (IOT)
## Trait Conflict custom method 
- Add series of strings and Lists of strings
- Exclude self, give self as argument
- Trait conlficts are Unlock.cancellations
- Would be a good contribution to RL3
## Traits (All of them)
- Learn how to do trait types for leveling up
## Ultramyopic
- Showed up in level up traits, probably other negatives will too
  - This is apparently a RogueLibs bug, not mine.
## Underdark Citizen
- Take small damage if you walk into manhole instead of activating
  - Attempted
- Walkover version of flushyourself:
    [Error  : Unity Log] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
    Stack trace:
    BunnyMod.Content.BMObjects.Manhole_FlushYourself (Agent agent, ObjectReal __instance) (at <8abc5006f52b44d7a55c9ddabc9a0e08>:0)

    Hole.OnTriggerStay2D (UnityEngine.Collider2D other) (at <5b00a25014d74f7f862ecdd1d48f7c04>:0)
    - This only occurred when no other manholes were open. There were active toilets.
    - Walkover version also only sends to self.
    - One manhole keeps getting excluded. Check that the random selection from lists isn't excluding anything from the running.
- Water splash
  - Needs a delay. It's appearing before the player is.
    - Attempted Immediate teleportation
  - No longer working
- Manhole to Toilet
  - Attempted
- Toilet to Manhole
  - Attempted
## Veiled Threats
- Go hostile if Annoyed
  - Attempted
## Vendor Stand
- Show (Empty) after stolen from
## Very Hard On Yourself
- Added the following XP boni and mali, will need testing particularly with VHOY
  - AngeredMany = "AngeredMany",
  - BQMalusDowntown = "BQMalusDowntown",
  - BQMalusFloor = "BQMalusFloor",
  - BQMalusGame = "BQMalusGame",
  - BQMalusIndustrial = "BQMalusIndustrial",
  - BQMalusPark = "BQMalusPark",
  - BQMalusSlums = "BQMalusSlums",
  - BQMalusUptown = "BQMalusUptown",
  - ElectabilityMalus = "ElectabilityMalus",
  - FailedToFreePrisoners = "FailedToFreePrisoners",
  - StoleNone = "StoleNone",
  - TookLotsOfDamage = "TookLotsOfDamage";
- Show Innocent/Guilty indicators
  - Attempted
## Wall Mods
- Non-Randomized Walls
- BasicWall.Spawn
- Leave Bars & Barbed Wire alone. An Uptown House has itself encircled by bars, so it merges into the main walls.
## Wall Mods - Border Walls
- LoadLevel.SetupBasicLevel?
  - Accepted. Omits some borders but it works.
## Warlord
- Remove XP Extortion Reward
  - Attempted
- Customize dialogue
  - Dialogue works, but need more variations

- Burned Lots

#
# Fixing
Implemented features that have bug(s) that need to be fixed before release.

#
# Balancing
Implemented and Bugfixed features that need balancing before release.

---

## Pyromancy
- Refire delay is a little too long
## Telemancy
- Miscast chance with Wild Casting is way too high, or not accurate enough.
- Reduce or at least randomize Dizzy duration. Guessing 5s instead of 10s.


#
# Finalization
- Do renames *only when the code is complete*.
- Complete and win a run with each new feature, and successfully load a return to home base. This would be a full cycle of the code you can expect to run into.
- Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.
- Update Sprites
- Increment the Version Number!

# Shelved
Out-of-scope features and notes for them; any bugs not worth fixing yet; avenues for codebase exploration

---

- AccessTools argument additions (new Type[1] {etc} often missing)

- RandomSelection.LoadRandomness is a good place to find lists to modify 

- Targetable Items
  - InvItem.OperateItem appears to be near the beginning of this chain
    - Goes all the way down to ObjectReal.LaptopHack

- XP Rewards
  - Explore GC.Stats
  - Good for Path traits
    - Fire.DestroyMe() for Path Of Fire

## FloorMod Exteriors
### Scratchpad notes
- Check out the Lake generator in LevelGen, it might have what you need to finally figure this out.
- BasicFloor
  - SetExtraFloorParams
    - Attempted: Water
      - WORKS: Interior floors only, and only seems to make stuff float if set to water. No appearance or other behaviors. Maybe upstream this?
  - Spawn
    - WORKS: Interior floors
- BasicSpawn
  - Spawn
    - This one calls BasicFloor.Spawn
- LoadLevel
  - FillFloors
    - Does not seem to have an effect. Left as Industrial to keep an eye out.
  - FillMapChunks
    - WORKS: Exterior floors, split by level
  - LoadStuff2
- ObjectMult
  - LoadChunkWorldDataFloor
- RandomFloorsWalls
- ReadChunks
  - ReadChild
- SpawnerFloor
  - SetExtraFloorParams
    - WORKS: Affects only certain portions of Home Base
  - spawn
    - WORKS: Affects Home Base only
- TileInfo
  - BuildFloorTileAtPosition
  - setFloor *
    - Attempted
      - I think this ended up turning the whole homebase into water. SunkenCity had just been on and no effect was observed on the game itself.
  - SetupFloorTile
  - SetupFloorTiles


			CustomMutator SunkenCity = RogueLibs.CreateCustomMutator(cChallenge.SunkenCity, true,
				new CustomNameInfo("Floor Exteriors: Sunken City"),

			SunkenCity.Available = true;
			SunkenCity.Conflicting.AddRange(cChallenge.AffectsFloors);
			SunkenCity.IsActive = false;

			CustomMutator TransitExperiment = RogueLibs.CreateCustomMutator(cChallenge.TransitExperiment, true,
				new CustomNameInfo("Floor Exteriors: Transit Experiment"),
				new CustomNameInfo("The City's authorities considered making all the public streets into conveyor belts, but that was too hard to mod into the game... er, I mean construct. Yeah."));
			TransitExperiment.Available = true;
			TransitExperiment.Conflicting.AddRange(cChallenge.AffectsFloors);
			TransitExperiment.IsActive = false;

  - I think I get this algorithm now: the original spot they're locating is the blank between two placed trashcans. That's why you often see them right next to each other with a gap in between.
