# Implementation
Features for the current update designated to be within scope.

---
## URGENT
Can't punch doors anymore :joy
## Afraid of Loud Noises
- if a silenced weapon runs out and the next one to be selected is too loud, it'll keep clicking the triggeron the quiet gun because it can't switch. Instead it should skip the loud one and switch to a quiet weapon even if out of order.
  - Attempted
- Now there's a name conflict. Remember, these are all strings so none can share a name.
  - There are conflicts between trait names and trait dialogue, e.g. this one and DAREdevil
## All dialogue
- Might need to change to Status Text.
  - Attempted
- See if Say leads to SayDialogue or vice versa, and note the changes that take place there.
## Blessed Strikes
- Not playing any audio though, may need to restore some of that A/V method you gutted
  - Attempted
- Add Undead damage
  - Attempted
- Weapon gate (BS+)
  - Attempted
- When complete, hold off release until zombie/priest
## DoubleTapper
- Hidden + unaware + distance
  - Attempted
- Headshot text no longer working
  - Attempted
## Eagle Eyes
- Test Upgrade - what happens?
- Also conflicts with Rogue Vision
  - That might be a good place to find if theere's one variable that can be adjusted for all of this.
- Things to try:
  - ObjectRealOnCamer
    - Attempted
  - BrainUpdate.RogueVisionChecks()
  - BrainUpdate.DoObjectChecks()
  - Agent.AgentOnCamera()
  - PlayerAgent.agentCamera.ZoomFactor
  - PlayerControl.myCamera.zoomLevel
  - CameraScript.RealAwake
## Knockback mods
- Attempted
## Slot Machine
- Jackpot
  - Split into hack & non-hack versions
    - Attempted
  - Still need to gate some sound effects, but after test
## Sniper
- Restrict to Revolver
  - Attempted
- Non-collision with hiddenIn object
  - Find bullet collision with object method, and except it if it's that object.
    - Attempted
## Floor Mods
- Interiors (BasicFloor.Spawn)
  - Detect edge cases that you never want to replace. Graveyards are turning into the chosen type.
    - These could also be set by Chunk type, maybe.
- Try for Exterior [DO NOT DELETE any attempts here, there are a *ton* of places to attempt]
  - RandomFloorsWalls
  - LoadLevel.FillFloors
    - Attempted Floor Tile Group Replacement
## Infernal Strikes 
- Unarmed 
  - Attempted
- Weapon gate (IS+)
  - Attempted
- Extra damage to non-Undead
  - Attempted
- When complete, hold off release until zombie/priest
## Spelunky Dory
- Cave outcroppings
  - Ensure They adjoin Cave Walls only, there should be enough example algos in that method to demonstrate how to do it.
  - Change from Altar to Wall
    - Attempted
## Stealth Bastard Deluxe
- Open Doors Silently
  - Re-copied Door.Open
    - Didn't work
  - May want to check out Relationships.OwnCheck, or where and when it's called in these methods.
  - Attempted
    - Ensure that this doesn't allow you to completely avoid OwnCheck. There's a possibility it will go too far and you'll be able to open doors right in front of them.
  - NEW: Consider that there might be another Door method called UseKey or something? That's the only time this has failed. I think you just need to patch that one.
- Hide Offset adjustment
  - Works well for Plant on North & South
  - Big Table doesn't work at all
    - Accepted
  - Northwall Bathtub bounces out
  - PoolTable
    - No offset?
  - Trash Can
    - Guessing South
- Object transparency
  - Plant has no transform, was able to walk through it when hidden
    - Can't be the rule for all of them, especially the big ones. Then NPCs will path through I think. unless they do path around such objects? It's possible just for visual/realism
## Trait Conflict custom method 
- Add series of strings and Lists of strings
- Exclude self, give self as argument
## Underdark Citizen

#
# Balancing
Implemented and Bugfixed features that need balancing before release.

---

## Telemancy
- Miscast chance with Wild Casting is way too high, or not accurate enough.
- Reduce or at least randomize Dizzy duration. Guessing 5s instead of 10s.


#
# Finalization
- Do renames *only when the code is complete*.
- Complete and win a run with each new feature, and successfully load a return to home base. This would be a full cycle of the code you can expect to run into.
- Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.
- Update Sprites
- Increment the Version Number!

## Release Notes 

- New Mutators

Out-of-scope features and notes for them; any bugs not worth fixing yet; avenues for codebase exploration

- AccessTools argument additions (new Type[1] {etc} often missing)
  - Slot machine may have been addressed

- RandomSelection.LoadRandomness is a good place to find lists to modify 

- RogueLibs conflicts not working right

    Abbysssal — 
    Available determines whether a trait will exist in the game. 
    IsActive determines whether that trait will appear in the game (can be toggled on/off in the Traits Menu at Home Base).
    I think you should just patch StatusEffects.GetUpgradeTraits
    ```

- Targetable Items
  - InvItem.OperateItem appears to be near the beginning of this chain
    - Goes all the way down to ObjectReal.LaptopHack

  - Buy fake pass from Fixer
    - Resistance Leader would work in meantime?
  - Hack Elevator
    - Failure means flood of law enforcement and lockout to that avenue

  - Don't spawn correctly on North-facing walls.
    - It is possible that SecurityCam has Snap-To-Wall behaviors built-in that Trashcans don't. 
      - Try removing this algorithm's snap-to-wall portions in order to not interrupt the Camera's code from doing its thing.
    - Postfixed SetVars with `shiftAmountS = -0.16f`
      - Didn't work
  - I think I get this algorithm now: the original spot they're locating is the blank between two placed trashcans. That's why you often see them right next to each other with a gap in between.
    - So you can probably greatly simplify this algorithm to just use the spot in the middle.
- The Law
  - This would be a whole different playstyle here, wouldn't it?
  - No removal of Wanted if you fuck up this badly. You're now persona non grata.
