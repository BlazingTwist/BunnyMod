=== TEST NOTES =================================================================

Traits with Contraindications still show up in upgrade menu.

Chronomancy
	LandedOnLand bug has reoccurred, people bounce forever.
		Could not replicate. Hopefully just misinterpreted what I saw earlier, might have been rapidly entering/exiting water.
	Stomp no longer working
		Search all methods with Stomp as a string, ensure that all are patched.
			Ignored the following:
				ObjectMultAgent.convertIntToSpecialAbility
				ObjectMultAgent.convertSpecialAbilityToInt
				PlayfieldObject.FindDamage
				ObjectMult.GetExplosionType
					This one has a chain under analyses of Cmd/Rpc methods that appear to do more than logging. May need to add HammerTime to the byte list.
					In the meantime, ObjectMult.SpawnExplosion sets the byte to 14 (stomp) so it should perform identically in some respects.
				Explosion.HasLOSExplosion
					Leaving this one alone may allow it to destroy Steel Doors. Test that before concluding you can skip this.
				Explosion.PlaySoundAfterTick
					Analysis claims unused, but that may be a quirk of DNSpy - I think it is used.

=== TASKS ======================================================================

--- BUGS ---------------------------------------------------

- Stove:
	Make noise when operated
	Count as strike for annoyance. Specifically Neutral or Annoyed statuses.

- Stove name hovers after use. Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. 
	Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that. I believe this only occurs if you have a Wrench.
- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up
	This calls Stove.MoveNext, which is not one of mine.

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items 


Fat Head message triggers on entering level.
	Also presumably occurs with other equipment traits.

On Exit to Base, then freeze on loading screen:
	[Message: Bunny Mod] Stove (1104): Stove_RevertAllVars
	[Error  : Unity Log] Error in ResetObjectReal: Stove (1104) (Stove) - Stove

Pyromancy
	Cooldown triggers on miscast or runout, not just on release. Need to ensure that player can hold down and it'll keep recharging.
	item.Categories.Add("Weapons"); // Might this set off sensors?
	Something caused BurnedOut to stay true even when recharged.
		My first guess is that that need to be an Async method, rather than relying solely on Recharge.

Telemancy
	[Warning: RogueLibs] SPECIAL HOLD 0.0333638
	[Message: Bunny Mod] Telemancy OnHeld;
	Telemancy Charge: 0
	[Warning: RogueLibs] SPECIAL HOLD 0.0501201
	[Message: Bunny Mod] Telemancy OnHeld;
	Telemancy Charge: 25
	[Warning: RogueLibs] SPECIAL HOLD 0.0665654
	[Message: Bunny Mod] Telemancy OnHeld;
	Telemancy Charge: 25
		... Many many times. it's triggering on Held, not on release. Always 25 charge.
			Abbysssal: the method is supposed to update the abilitys state, so just use the ref float time parameter
	Also not recharging anymore.
	
--- IMPLEMENTATIONS ----------------------------------------

All
	Verify that all methods created are actually used, because you made them en masse as a framework before explicit need.

Chronomancy
	REALLY need a review, possibly with a flowchart of the boolean flags. Need strict definitions and to be fully aware of when they're set and read. Otherwise this is a ticking timebomb for bugs.
		Recharge now triggers constantly.
	Hammertime's requirement for Chronomancy isn't working in the character builder.
	Hammertime no longer working again.
	Need log messages for Timescale and Hammertime. Timescale felt like it was not functioning properly this time.

Pyromancy
	Uniques
		Fan of Fire - 3 flames per shot // Fan of Fire + - 5 per shot
			These should both be set to an angle proportionate to their speed. If the speed is high, keep them narrow. If it's low, keep them wide and more like a fan. They also decrease 
		Ring of Fire - Shorter range, 
	Still don't have a delay between cast and recharge

Telemancy
	Uniques:
		EMP on teleport?
		Stun on teleport?
	Rework: 
		Pinpoint accuracy may be nearly possible from the start, but would be time-consuming or possibly cause a miscast.
		On Hold:
			Held Time ++
				Miscast Roll based on this and skills
			Mana --
			charge ++
		MisCast effects, ascending:
			Light & visual effect, attracting attention
			Tiny Stroke
			Large amount of damage
		Combined with:
			Random place in level
			Random item from inventory is dropped and then disappears


--- BALANCING ----------------------------------------------

Telemancy
	Currently, it miscasts at >35
	Change Wild Casting to increase the rate of recharge or lower the cost of casting.
	Focused casting can benefit accuracy.

=== RELEASE NOTES ==============================================================

BEFORE RELEASE:
	Complete and win a run with each new feature, and successfully load a return to home base. This would be a full cycle of the code you can expect to run into.
	Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.
	Increment the Version number!
	Update Sprites

1.2.2
- Added Chronomancy & Pyromancy
- Reworked Telemancy completely, and renamed existing general magic traits
- Stoves now explode like Molotovs when destroyed
- Fixed various bugs

=== NEXT RELEASE ===============================================================

Mugging
	Disable until next release! This is Scope Creep.
