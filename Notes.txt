- Current focus: try to prefer guards over nesting

HIGH PRIORITY	√

- Ideas:
	BULLET TIIIIME
	the point value is 5, and recharge is 10 seconds long after use
	upgrade traits are making the slowdown longer and the recharge shorter
	Description: "make time run to near-zero for everyone else except you."
	During slowdown, your character's speed is given a +4
	i'm sure you could make it a status effect like fast, but faster

- General Arcane traits:
	Arcane Training: Greatly reduces the chance of miscasting a spell. (Spells will always have a 1% chance to miscast)
	Wild Magic: Increases chance of miscast to 5%, but supercharges most spells.

- Trait incompatibilities:
	Weapon Traits: Stubby Fingers, Sausage Fingers
	Afraid of Loud Noises / Draw No Blood

- Blink does not go indoors

- Fridge not showing button text for showchest

- Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that.

- Stove name hovers after use (Which button? Both?)

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items

See Refrigerator_ObjectACtion for the above, pressing Tamper


- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up
	This calls Stove.MoveNext, which is not one of mine.


LOW PRIORITY	√

- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
- Stoves appear to no longer rotate toward walls
- Auto-trayed items may include those you can't use/equip


1.2.2
- Test whether setting Available to false is actually working for upgrade traits
