ISSUES: 

HIGH PRIORITY
- Quick Heal button leads to endless cycle of attempting to use prohibited items.
- keep getting the BluntOnly message when a weapon breaks
- Hacking on Vending machines is cancelled (with no message)
	- [Message: Bunny Mod] ObjectReal_FinishedOperating
	- Sellomatic
- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items
- Quick Health selects for highest-HP item, can get no eligible item when there might actually be one

LOW PRIORITY
- Stove sprite turns into pink square when highlighted pre-Interaction
- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
