ISSUES: 

HIGH PRIORITY
- Use Quick Heal with only a prohibited healing item, inventory menu will repeatedly close and reopen.
	Might be in InvDatabase.ChooseHealthItem... but it ain't pretty
- keep getting the BluntOnly message when a weapon breaks
- Laptop & Hacking Device interactions are canceled
- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items

LOW PRIORITY
- Stove sprite turns into pink square when highlighted pre-Interaction
- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
