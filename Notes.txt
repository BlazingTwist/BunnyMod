- Current focus: try to prefer guards over nesting

TEST NOTES

- Chronomancy
	Values for time shift appear to be reversed. Normal use moves the whole game forward at hyperspeed. 

- Pyromancy
	Can only aim North
	No rapid fire


HIGH PRIORITY or TRIVIAL TO IMPLEMENT √

- Move all Magic traits to a scale of 0-100

- Trait incompatibilities:
	Weapon Traits: Stubby Fingers, Sausage Fingers
	Afraid of Loud Noises / Draw No Blood

- Fridge not showing button text for showchest

- Stove name hovers after use. Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that. I believe this only occurs if you have a Wrench.

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items 

- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up
	This calls Stove.MoveNext, which is not one of mine.

LOW PRIORITY	√

- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
- Stoves appear to no longer rotate toward walls
- Auto-trayed items may include those you can't use/equip

IDEAS 
- BULLET TIME
	the point value is 5, and recharge is 10 seconds long after use
	upgrade traits are making the slowdown longer and the recharge shorter
	Description: "make time run to near-zero for everyone else except you."
	During slowdown, your character's speed is given a +4
	i'm sure you could make it a status effect like fast, but faster
