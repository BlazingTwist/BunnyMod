- Current focus: try to prefer guards over nesting

TEST NOTES

- Chronomancy
	Flags appear to persist between runs.

HIGH PRIORITY or TRIVIAL TO IMPLEMENT √

- Move all Magic traits to a scale of 0-100

- Trait incompatibilities:
	Weapon Traits: Stubby Fingers, Sausage Fingers
	Afraid of Loud Noises / Draw No Blood

- Fridge not showing button text for showchest

- Stove name hovers after use. Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that. I believe this only occurs if you have a Wrench.

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items 

- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up
	This calls Stove.MoveNext, which is not one of mine.

LOW PRIORITY	√

- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
- Stoves appear to no longer rotate toward walls
- Auto-trayed items may include those you can't use/equip

IDEAS 

    Seperation Anxiety; cost: -3
        If you have no followers, you suffer lowered accuracy, melee, and speed. (decrease of 1 in each stat)

    Arrogant; cost: -4
        People get mad at you a lot more easily (when people would normally become annoyed, they instead bacome hostile

oh btw
theres probably a reason you cant teleport while falling or jumping into water
so in case you havent you probably should put a restriction on blink for that

1.2.2
- Test whether setting Available to false is actually working for upgrade traits
