=== TEST NOTES =================================================================

- Chronomancy
	All set. Now add balance and upgrades.

	Still needs a trigger cooldown, however.

	Candidate variables to modify:
		Mana cost increment
		Timescales


- Pyromancy
	Reduce Miscast reduction of MagicTraining / Might need Float operations to do this correctly
	Reduce Miscast chance with Wild Casting
	Increase upgrade prices of all Magic traits
	Add a delay between use and recharge, and between use and use.

- Telemancy
	Currently, it miscasts at >35
	The very base level of this trait needs to be at least somewhat useful.
	Change Wild Casting to increase the rate of rechard or lower the cost of casting.
	Focused casting can benefit accuracy.
	Uniques:
		EMP on teleport?
		Stun on teleport?

- Electromancy

- Document if NegaFud bug is addressed

- Test whether setting Available to false is actually working for upgrade traits
	The code changes were made, now just keep an eye out.

- Verify if correct Tool durability cost is displaying in menus.

=== HIGH PRIORITY or TRIVIAL √ ==================================================

BEFORE RELEASE:
	Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.

Telemancy 
	The level-1 version of this is pretty horrible.

- Stove:
	Make noise when operated
	Count as strike for annoyance. Specifically Neutral or Annoyed statuses.

- Tamper Tantrum still shows 30 as tamper cost

- Trait incompatibilities:
	Weapon Traits: Stubby Fingers, Sausage Fingers, Draw no blood, pacifist
	Afraid of Loud Noises / Draw No Blood

- Fridge not showing button text for showchest

- Stove name hovers after use. Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that. I believe this only occurs if you have a Wrench.

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items 

- Stove name hovers after use. Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. 
	Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that. I believe this only occurs if you have a Wrench.
- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up
	This calls Stove.MoveNext, which is not one of mine.

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items 

=== LOW PRIORITY √ =============================================================

- Fridge not showing button text for showchest
- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
- Stoves appear to no longer rotate toward walls
- Auto-trayed items may include those you can't use/equip

- Create Agent magic remora
	Hold off on this. Extension method and bitwise values in un-used variables might be all we need for now.


=== IDEAS ======================================================================

Magic items:
	- Mana Crystals (decay slowly but unpredictably, increase recharge speed)
	- Miscast Crystals (Rare, but absorb a miscast and shatter)
	- Ultrachungus Crystals (Temporarily boost your ability to obscene levels)

Chronomancy - Special trait for fast-punching so you can be a fast-punching type of person

    Seperation Anxiety; cost: -3
        If you have no followers, you suffer lowered accuracy, melee, and speed. (decrease of 1 in each stat)

    Arrogant; cost: -4
        People get mad at you a lot more easily (when people would normally become annoyed, they instead bacome hostile

	SACRIFICE
		You can only regain health by burning corpses

	Annoying;
		Everyone's annoyed to begin with

oh btw
theres probably a reason you cant teleport while falling or jumping into water
so in case you havent you probably should put a restriction on blink for that


=== RELEASE NOTES ==============================================================

1.2.2
- Chronomancy
- Finalization and renaming of Telemancy and generalist magic traits


=== OTHER ======================================================================
BITWISE OPERATIONS:
you can use unused fields in the InvItem, like InvItem.otherDamage. These will work even if you restart the game.
Getting 1st bit: (item.otherDamage & 0b_0001) != 0
Getting 2nd bit: (item.otherDamage & 0b_0010) != 0
Getting 3rd bit: (item.otherDamage & 0b_0100) != 0
and so on

Setting 1st bit: item.otherDamage |= 0b_0001
Setting 2nd bit: item.otherDamage |= 0b_0010
Setting 3rd bit: item.otherDamage |= 0b_0100

you can replace these with methods:

public static bool IsFirstThingActive(int bitfield)
    => (bitfield & 0b_0001) != 0;

public static void SetFirstThing(ref int bitfield, bool value)
{
    if (value) bitfield |= 0b_0001;
    else bitfield &= ~0b_0001;
}

&	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
|	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
~	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
<<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
>>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
