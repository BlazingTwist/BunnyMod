- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up


LOW PRIORITY
- Stove sprite turns into pink square when highlighted pre-Interaction
- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
- Stoves appear to no longer rotate toward walls


1.2.1
- Quick Heal button now works properly for those with dietary restriction traits.
