- SMILE, YOU'RE HAVING FUN!

HIGH PRIORITY	√

- Fridge not showing button text for showchest
	√

- Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that.

- Stove name hovers after use (Which button? Both?)

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items

See Refrigerator_ObjectACtion for the above, pressing Tamper


- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up
	This calls Stove.MoveNext, which is not one of mine.


LOW PRIORITY	√

- Stove sprite turns into pink square when highlighted pre-Interaction
- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
- Stoves appear to no longer rotate toward walls


1.2.1
- Quick Heal button now works properly for those with dietary restriction traits.
- Stoves no longer turn into pink squares
