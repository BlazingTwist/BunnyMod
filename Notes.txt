=== TEST NOTES =================================================================

--- BALANCING ----------------------------------------------

Telemancy
	Currently, it miscasts at >35
	Change Wild Casting to increase the rate of recharge or lower the cost of casting.
	Focused casting can benefit accuracy.

--- BUGS ---------------------------------------------------

Fat Head message triggers on entering level.
	Also presumably occurs with other equipment traits.

Verify if correct Tool durability cost is displaying in menus.

Test whether setting Available to false is actually working for upgrade traits
	The code changes were made, now just keep an eye out.

NegaFud 

On Exit to Base, then freeze on loading screen:
	[Message: Bunny Mod] Stove (1104): Stove_RevertAllVars
	[Error  : Unity Log] Error in ResetObjectReal: Stove (1104) (Stove) - Stove

--- IMPLEMENTATIONS ----------------------------------------

Chronomancy
	Hammertime Triggers when exiting water, even if you don't have the trait.
		This no longer occurs, the actual stomp was apparently broken somewhere. Need to check commits 2-5 before this one to verify what was changed.
	Hammertime Still doesn't do any damage to others. Hopefully there's a way, not sure what Vanilla Stomp does.

Electromancy
	Split only triggers when it hits a wall, not an agent.

Pyromancy
	Add a delay between use and recharge, and between use and use.

Telemancy
	Uniques:
		EMP on teleport?
		Stun on teleport?
	Rework: 
		Charge to cast, release when you feel like it or when charge at max.
		Pinpoint accuracy may be nearly possible from the start, but would be time-consuming or possibly cause a miscast.

=== HIGH PRIORITY or TRIVIAL ====================================================

BEFORE RELEASE:
	Make a promo character for each special ability or trait group, to promote the mod and community at large.

BULLET MODDING (Re Electromancy & others)
Unused variables:
	string substance
	int damageMod

- Stove:
	Make noise when operated
	Count as strike for annoyance. Specifically Neutral or Annoyed statuses.


- Stove name hovers after use. Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that. I believe this only occurs if you have a Wrench.

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items 

- Stove name hovers after use. Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. 
	Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that. I believe this only occurs if you have a Wrench.
- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up
	This calls Stove.MoveNext, which is not one of mine.

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items 

=== LOW PRIORITY or TEMPORARILY SHELVED ========================================

- Fridge not showing button text for showchest

- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.

- Stoves appear to no longer rotate toward walls

- Auto-trayed items may include those you can't use/equip

=== IDEAS ======================================================================

Big Quests
Get Thee Behind Me! - Kill all Zombies and Vampires on the map. Vampires are armed and travel in teams.
Slingin' Dope - NPCs with enough money to buy one of your drugs will have an arrow above their head when the Big Quest is open. You need to sell to a certain number of NPCs.
Z-Team - Zombie disaster occurs every level. Kill all Zombies and all living people carrying the Z-Virus. You get a free Friend Phone per level.

Items
There's currently no known way to get modded items' graphics to show up correctly, so I'm going to hold off on these.
Beer Can (1) - Generated when a Beer is consumed, or found on its own in trash cans. Thrown weapon, does minimal damage for funsies. Like a more useless Rock.
Door Locker (2) - Use on a Door to Lock it from both sides - activate the door to unlock it.
Doughnut (1) - Moderate healing. Can be given to Cops to make them Friendly, or to avoid paying a Fine.
Fire Mine (4) - Behaves like a Molotov when it explodes.
Fancy Hat (3) - Increased chances for persuasion. Maybe a Fedora, because I want you to cringe.
Fear Syringe (1) - (Maybe not possible since there's no fear for player characters)
Gas Trap Kit (6) - Combine with a Syringe to make a Gas Trap that you can place like a Land Mine.
Holy Symbol (4) - When in your inventory, all Undead NPCs slowly take damage when they're near you. They are more likely to flee during combat.
Holy Water Flask (2) - Thrown weapon that gives a Poison condition to Zombies & Werewolves. Can also be combined with a Water Gun, Air Vent, or Water Filter.
Lunchbox (1) - Thrown item. Deals rock-level damage, drops a food item on impact.
Mini Turret (3) - It's a Turret.
Oil Bottle (1) - Thrown weapon that creates a splash of oil upon impact.
Rifle (5) - High damage, slow rate of fire with warmup. Hopefully can extend range to beyond normal screen, like when using the Laptop.
Riot Armor (3) - Resists bullets and melee damage.
Riot Helmet (2) - Just another aesthetic option.
Screwdriver (1) - A stabbing weapon slightly weaker than the knife. Would be used for extended tampering options.
Spear (1) - Thrusting weapon, longest melee reach. Deals damage equal to Knife.
Sugar Processor (6) - Similar to Bomb Processor. 
Teleportation Trap (2) - Floor trap.
Toxic Slime Capsule (1) - Thrown item. Inflicts poison and leaves a Goop Splash.
Water Gun - Extended to combine with Oil Can, so you can shoot Oil.
Whiskey Bottle (1) - Generated when Whiskey is consumed, or found on its own in trash cans. Thrown weapon, does minimal damage for funsies. Like a more useless Rock.
Wire Cutters - Deactivate cameras instantly with no chance of failure. Destroy Barbed Wire fences. Other stuff?
Z-Virus (2) - Solely for putting in Vents or Water Pumps. Doesn't do damage, but infects people with Zombiism.


Game Behaviors & NPC Interactions

General NPCs
Change NPC behaviors during some disasters. E.g., Zombie attacks will cause cops to stop enforcing minor laws like property destruction. Some NPCs will join you automatically for safety.

Bouncers
You can come in if for free if they see you smoke cigarettes. Because obviously it means you're cool.

Cops 
Will attempt to fine you for petty crimes like destroying trash cans, instead of going hostile.
Bribe is a % chance to succeed, annoy, or turn them hostile.

Cop Bots
Cop Bot - Tamper to deactivate them (Requires One Happy Tamper or Tech Expert). Maybe this will be a % chance for them to trust you, like robbing/extorting.

Gang Members
Will attempt to mug you like Mobsters, but for a smaller amount ($50).

Jocks 
Might decide to punch you in the face. You know, as a prank.

Rogue Vision
I'd like to make a few modifications to gameplay to make this Mutator more playable. I prefer it for Stealth runs, but the inability to peek around corners is sort of an Achilles Heel. However, modding Field of Vision is probably too ambitious for my level (not to mention RV isn't a game mode that gets a lot of attention), so this will likely remain a pipe dream.
Visual indicators of where sounds are coming from. This would include doors opening/closing, security cameras swiveling, etc. 
The ability to see Cameras' field of vision if you've hacked them, or an item specific to that.
A Special ability that places or picks up a Spy Camera for observing patrols. Or, a moveable Scout Drone.
A Mirror you can use to peek around corners.

Scientists
Hire to put poison in a Vent.

Slum Dwellers
Will occasionally beg you for $5, and become annoyed if you refuse. Very small chance of going hostile. If you offer them food they'll just get annoyed.

Thieves
Can be hired to unlock Safes


Mutators
All Walls Are Wood
All Walls Are Steel


Objects
Cash Register - A tough locked object containing money, that may be unlocked through the chunk's Computer, Hacked, Lockpicked, or pried open with a Crowbar. Easier than a Safe, yes, but almost always within the view of their owner.
Chemistry Set - Sacrifice a syringe to identify that type.
Dumpster - A big metal dumpster that you can hide in, for settings where Bushes or Bathtubs aren't appropriate.
Oil Barrel - A Rust-colored barrel which creates an oil pool when destroyed.
Kitchen Fryer - When destroyed, leaves a pool of oil.
Pay Phone - Call the Resistance to send a Specialist over. Choose between Hacker, Thief, and Goon. 
Refrigerator - Tamper to make it Run after a 10s countdown
Safe - Open with Detonator.
Security Door - Steel door, not openable with lockpick or crowbar. Can only be opened via a connected computer.
Television - Tamper to make it increase in volume immediately, and explode after a 10s countdown
Trampoline - Does annoying jumping behavior. I hate it already.
Other Objects - Simply for visual variety when making custom chunks. Statues, park benches, filing cabinets, glass tables, office chairs, paintings, gym equipment, beer taps, curtains, etc. 

Object interactions
Air Conditioning Unit - Tamper to Release Gas without access to main computer (not sure about this one). 
Generator & Overclocked Generator - Able to Rig to Detonate via Hacking. Maybe only through computer, who knows. This one will be very OP for anyone with a Laptop, but Laptops are already OP.
Speaker - Tamper or Hack to make it very loud, blowing wind like the Air Gun.
Toilet - Tamper to...? Maybe spray water like hydrant, useful for keeping hallways clear. Or maybe some other behavior, not sure yet.

Drug Dealer
Death to Snitches - Cops will ignore your Pusher attempts. You may attempt to sell to them, but failure will turn them hostile.
Pusher - You can interact with most NPCs to attempt to sell them any drug item you have (or simplified, just Sugar). If you fail, they become annoyed (Upper Crusters will call the cops immediately). Cops who witness a dealing attempt will go Hostile. If you succeed at a sale, they have a chance to become Hooked. After a certain interval of withdrawal, NPCs will gain the Jonesing status. They'll seek you out in the level and beg you for a particular drug. If you go too long without selling them the requested drug, they'll go hostile, but selling them other types of drugs will keep them at bay for a while. When Jonesing, they will freely give you keys and safe combos if you ask. Jonesing NPCs may also attack other drug dealers, doctors, or scientists if they can't track you down.

General (Like Miscellaneous, not like an Army General)
Alcoholic (-4) - Might be interesting to have an Addict trait but with alcohol.
Animal Whisperer - Gorillas and Werewolves are Loyal
Bonkist (2) - Backstabbing with a blunt weapon leaves the target Dizzy, if they survive. (Considering making this a small chance with all blunt hits, not just backstabs)

Cheeky Trappy - All hidden traps (so far just landmines) are visible to you. NPCs will no longer path around traps that you place.

eg: youre cannibal, level up and leave slums 1. You have a choice between im outtie, low cost jobs, and - malodorous.

portable merc machine:

yeah, its exactly the same as the normal merc machine, but as an inventory item.

Alright my idea is that npcs can become "fearful" of the player if you just torture them in some ways
Such as killing all of their teammates
Also stuff like eating corpses could give them fear
Or just continuosly destroying alredy dead npcs could give fear
When a npc is fearfull they will hide and try to evade you at all times
If they are from a faction they could search for another npc of that faction and treath it as a safeplace
There could be npcs that are unable to feel fear such as robots and zombies

Overall rework of NPC view distance.
	Probably increase the vanilla distance for balance.
	+ Giant, Loud, Lights, etc.
	- Diminutive, Darkness, etc.

Beggar | 2 Points | Beg random people for something. Either get a food item or cigarettes. 50/50 Chance. Success will make Agent friendly, failure will annoy them.
	You can reattempt but they might go hostile.

Putting the "Drunk" status effect back into the game!
how?: well it could only happear if you have certain traits here are some ideas:
Low tolerance to alcohol: "you get badly drunk after some drinks"
 When you drink to much beer you will get the drunk status and you accuracy and melee will go down temporarily but you can recover easily and if you just overdrink you can end up bafing removing all of you status effects wich is both good and bad (for example if you have poison this can save you)
Bar Brawler: "You get more powerful after some drinks"
 If you drink to much you will get drunk which gives you a + on melee
Bonus:
 A golden trait for the robot Alcohol Energy Source makes "alcohol into energy"
 Drinking while already at full hp gives you some seconds in the energy level but it cannot make you go up by a level so it just gives you seconds.
 
Path Of Fire - 
	You can only regain health by burning corpses. 
	Extra XP for killing firemen.
	Extra XP for burning objects (like 1 per).
	Take damage in Water.
	Lose XP when you or firemen extinguish fires.
Big Quest - Burn a certain number of corpses
