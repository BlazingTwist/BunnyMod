=== TEST NOTES =================================================================

- Chronomancy
	Flags appear to persist between runs.
		This one is now ready to test, using Abby's bitwise and extension method advice



- Document if NegaFud bug is addressed

- Test whether setting Available to false is actually working for upgrade traits

- Verify if correct Tool durability cost is displaying in menus.

=== HIGH PRIORITY or TRIVIAL √ ==================================================

Chronomancy:
	The triggers for cinematic slow-mo are throwing off your flags. You probably need pre- and post-fixes to simply deactivate those if the ability is available.

Telemancy 
	The level-1 version of this is pretty horrible.

- Stove:
	Make noise when operated
	Count as strike for annoyance. Specifically Neutral or Annoyed statuses.

- Stove name hovers after use. Can't tamper w stove after cooking on it. 
	Verified that ObjectReal_Interact is not triggering after that. I believe this only occurs if you have a Wrench.
- Stove blinks when damaged but never actually blows up
	This calls Stove.MoveNext, which is not one of mine.

- Extend weapon ban traits to Use-Items, not just Equip-Items 

=== LOW PRIORITY √ =============================================================

- Fridge not showing button text for showchest
- Object interactions show a "Cancelled" message even though they went through successfully.
- Stoves appear to no longer rotate toward walls
- Auto-trayed items may include those you can't use/equip

- Create Agent magic remora
	Hold off on this. Extension method and bitwise values in un-used variables might be all we need for now.


=== IDEAS ======================================================================

    Seperation Anxiety; cost: -3
        If you have no followers, you suffer lowered accuracy, melee, and speed. (decrease of 1 in each stat)

    Arrogant; cost: -4
        People get mad at you a lot more easily (when people would normally become annoyed, they instead bacome hostile

	Annoying;
		Everyone's annoyed to begin with

oh btw
theres probably a reason you cant teleport while falling or jumping into water
so in case you havent you probably should put a restriction on blink for that


=== RELEASE NOTES ==============================================================

1.2.2
- Chronomancy
- Finalization and renaming of Telemancy and generalist magic traits


=== OTHER ======================================================================
BITWISE OPERATIONS:
you can use unused fields in the InvItem, like InvItem.otherDamage. These will work even if you restart the game.
Getting 1st bit: (item.otherDamage & 0b_0001) != 0
Getting 2nd bit: (item.otherDamage & 0b_0010) != 0
Getting 3rd bit: (item.otherDamage & 0b_0100) != 0
and so on

Setting 1st bit: item.otherDamage |= 0b_0001
Setting 2nd bit: item.otherDamage |= 0b_0010
Setting 3rd bit: item.otherDamage |= 0b_0100

you can replace these with methods:

public static bool IsFirstThingActive(int bitfield)
    => (bitfield & 0b_0001) != 0;

public static void SetFirstThing(ref int bitfield, bool value)
{
    if (value) bitfield |= 0b_0001;
    else bitfield &= ~0b_0001;
}

&	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
|	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
~	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
<<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
>>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
