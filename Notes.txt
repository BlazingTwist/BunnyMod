In particular, it affects chests, fire hydrants, and trash cans. Air Conditioning units, doors, shelves seem to be unaffected.

Possibility: 
	These are all objects that can be made "dead" once they're interacted with (emptied chests and trashcans). But that'd also go for AC units so...
	Also not sure why you can't hit them anymore.
